That doesn't seem like too much to ask.The thing is, it might be closer than we think. There are a lot of different ways to keep a human body and mind going long after its expiration date, and experiments are ongoing.If death is our end, then all we can do is die and hope for the best. But perhaps we donâ€™t have to die. Many respectable scientists now believe that humans can overcome death and achieve immortality through the use of future technologies. But how will we do this?Music Credits : __________________________________________________Martian Cowboy by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...)Source: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-...Artist: http://incompetech.com/
