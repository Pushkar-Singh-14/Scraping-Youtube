SpaceX Rewind 2018:-Building off its earlier momentum—8 launches in 2016 and 18 in 2017, SpaceX pulled off 21 launches in 2018, a staggering achievement for the 16-year-old company. SpaceX’s reusable rocket technology moved out of the proof-of-concept stage to become the backbone of a growing fleet of flight-proven rockets. Although the company landed its first rocket in 2015, it took until 2017 for SpaceX to reuse its first booster. This year landings became almost routine, and engineers bid farewell to the moderately reusable Falcons of yesterday, ushering in an era of more capable Falcons, dubbed the Block 5.Another long-standing goal was to debut its heavy-lift rocket, the Falcon Heavy. First estimated to fly back in 2013, the Falcon Heavy took its inaugural flight on Feb. 6th. After sending a cherry red Tesla roadster (complete with Starman pilot) on a journey past Mars, the three cores of the Falcon Heavy—each essentially its own Falcon 9 rocket—returned to Earth. Two of the boosters touched down in perfect synchronization on LZ-1 and LZ-2, SpaceX’s designated landing zones at Cape Canaveral. The Heavy’s center booster, however, missed its targeted landing spot on a waiting drone ship, and plopped into the Atlantic Ocean.Musk announced that Yusaku Maezawa was the mysterious billionaire who had reserved both seats the first paying customer on SpaceX’s next-generation rocket—the BFR. Billed from the start as an interplanetary transport vehicle, BFR (which is composed of two parts, a rocket and a spaceship capable of carrying hundreds of people into space)THUMBNAIL CREDITS:-  Joe Burbank, MBOMusic credits :-'Voyager by Jo BlankenburgYoutube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV6Yy...#ElonMusk #SpaceXRewind2018
