HELLO  GUYS  HOW  R  U  ALL  , IN  THIS  VIDEO  IM  TALK  ABOUT  4  FUTURE  INVENTIONS  IN  2050 .An invention is a unique or novel device, method, composition or process. The invention process is a process within an overall engineering and product development process. It may be an improvement upon a machine or product or a new process for creating an object or a result. An invention that achieves a completely unique function or result may be a radical breakthrough. Such works are novel and not obvious to others skilled in the same field. An inventor may be taking a big step in success or failure.Some inventions can be patented. A patent legally protects the intellectual property rights of the inventor and legally recognizes that a claimed invention is actually an invention. The rules and requirements for patenting an invention vary from country to country and the process of obtaining a patent is often expensive.Another meaning of invention is cultural invention, which is an innovative set of useful social behaviours adopted by people and passed on to others.[1] The Institute for Social Inventions collected many such ideas in magazines and books.[2] Invention is also an important component of artistic and design creativity. Inventions often extend the boundaries of human knowledge, experience or capability.Inventions are of three kinds: scientific-technological (including medicine), sociopolitical (including economics and law), and humanistic, or cultural.Scientific-technological inventions include railroads, aviation, vaccination, hybridization, antibiotics, astronautics, holography,the atomic bomb, computing, the Internet, and the smartphone.Sociopolitical inventions comprise new laws, institutions, and procedures that change modes of social behavior and establish new forms of human interaction and organization. Examples include the British Parliament, the US Constitution, the Manchester (UK) General Union of Trades, the Boy Scouts, the Red Cross, the Olympic Games, the United Nations, the European Union, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as movements such as socialism, Zionism, suffragism,feminism, and animal-rights veganism.DONT   FORGET  HIT  : L-I-K-ES-H-A-R-ES-U-B-S-C-R-I-B-EAFFILIATE  LINKS :MY  SET  UP :MY  PHONE : http://amzn.to/2n85SZRMY  COMPUTER : http://amzn.to/2Gcqg4IFOR  YOUTUBERS :BEST  MIC  FOR  YOUTUBERS : http://amzn.to/2E3psybBEST CAMERA FOR YOUTUBERS : http://amzn.to/2n7AF8KBEST LAPTOP FOR YOUTUBERS : http://amzn.to/2n3F78ESOCIAL  LINKS  :FACEBOOK : https://www.facebook.com/GuriKhindaOf...INSTAGRAM : https://www.instagram.com/guri_khinda...CONTACT  FOR  SPONSORSHIP : TARSEM9464@GMAIL.COMYOU  SHOULD  WATCH  THIS  : 11 .
