MygG9yoPKjQ,Big Bang Theory & Evolution of Our Universe - Space Science and Technology,"How was our Universe created? How did it come to be the seemingly infinite place we know of today? And what will become of it, ages from now? These are the questions that have been puzzling philosophers and scholars since the beginning the time, and led to some pretty wild and interesting theories. Today, the consensus among scientists, astronomers and cosmologists is that the Universe as we know it was created in a massive explosion that not only created the majority of matter, but the physical laws that govern our ever-expanding cosmos. This is known as The Big Bang Theory.",science and technology

dbo_wbfRZm0,25 Modern Science And Technologies You'd Swear Are Science Fiction,"It’s an undeniable fact that the newest technologies such as mobile tech, genetic engineering, and the emerging field of nanotech differ from the technologies that preceded them in a fundamental way. Our world is transforming rapidly and violently to the point where many people feel completely unable to comprehend and utilize these advancements. Ironically, we witnessed many of these new “things” and technologies in sci-fi films and graphic comics first, and if someone had told us back then that it would only take a couple of decades for these changes to enter our lives, we would have probably laughed.  Think about it: Back in the early ’90s emerging computer technology was used by a limited number of people worldwide, and now, a quarter century later, everyone has a smartphone and a laptop. Can you even imagine what the world will look like in 2030, even 2050? And the scariest part of all (especially if you’re a geek like me) is the fact that science fiction, the literature of the human species encountering vast, mind-altering changes, whether they arrive via scientific discoveries, technological innovations, natural events, aliens, or societal shifts, has recently lost its magic and glimpse to the point we wonder what is real and what is not nowadays. But if you think we’re being over-dramatic, then check out these 25 Modern Science And Technologies You'd Swear Are Science Fiction and you will see we’re not exaggerating at all.Follow us on:Twitter: https://twitter.com/list25Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/list25Website: http://list25.comInstagram: https://instagram.com/list25/Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/list25/Check out the physical list here: http://list25.com/25-modern-science-a...Voice control is now a trend The Cancer Gene FingerprintRobot snake automatically wraps around an object when thrownFlying carsFirst planet with FOUR suns discoveredNASA begins using robotic exoskeletonsDiamond planet discoveredArtificial leaves generate electricityVoyager I leaves the Solar SystemSelf-Driving bus is legal in Greece3-D printer creates full-size houses in one sessionDNA was photographed for the first timeGenetically modified silk is stronger than steelDARPA robot can traverse an obstacle courseLaser guns are now a realityEye implants give sight to the blindQuadriplegic successfully uses mind-controlled robotic armYou can swallow a pill-sized camera instead of invasive scopesinFORM 3-D display allows remote manipulation of physical objectsEngineers create a paper-thin robot skin that responds to touchScientists create Matrix-esque artificial wombHuman brain is hackedInvisibility cloak technology took a huge leap forwardSuperman’s view through walls becomes realityThe world’s first fully mind-controlled synthetic leg goes for a stroll",science and technology

Z62eeT0bXuk,Future Technology - New Science BBC Documentary HD,"Technology (from Greek τέχνη, techne, ""art, skill, cunning of hand""; and -λογία, -logia[3]) is the collection of techniques, methods or processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, etc. or it can be embedded in machines, computers, devices and factories, which can be operated by individuals without detailed knowledge of the workings of such things.The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans in travelling in and controlling their environment. Recent technological developments, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. However, not all technology has been used for peaceful purposes; the development of weapons of ever-increasing destructive power has progressed throughout history, from clubs to nuclear weapons.Technology has affected society and its surroundings in a number of ways. In many societies, technology has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as pollution, and deplete natural resources, to the detriment of Earth's environment. Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, a term originally applied only to machines, and the challenge of traditional norms.Philosophical debates have arisen over the present and future use of technology in society, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, opining that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition. Indeed, until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but recent scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and learned to pass their knowledge to other generations.Watch more: https://goo.gl/5SCZ6z   *** *** *** *** *** ***************************************************Thanks for WatchingPlease Like and Subscribe to Watch more videos",science and technology

The sheer size and scope of structures like the Great Pyramid at Giza or the Temple of Amun at Karnak or the Colossi of Memnon are literally awe-inspiring and naturally encourage questions regarding how they were built. All across the Egyptian landscape rise immense structures, thousands of years old, which have given rise to many different theories as to their construction. While a number of very significant questions remain unanswered, the simplest explanation for many can be found in ancient Egyptian inscriptions, texts, wall paintings, tomb inscriptions, art, and artifacts: the ancient Egyptians had an extraordinary command of science and technology.",science and technology

h4yP_Ltc97E,Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology,"The project to establish the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology was first announced in June 2001 by the Minister of State for Okinawa and Northern Territories Affairs and the Minister of State for Science and Technology Policy. The Japanese Cabinet Office promotes the project with the following three objectives:Firstly, to establish in Japan a leading center for research and education that will address new challenges in science and technology. Having achieved economic development through technological innovation, Japan is keen to make significant contributions to the advancement of science and technology. Today, many emerging fields of science and technology require multidisciplinary research. The Institute will focus on integrative approaches to high level research and education. Secondly, to provide a successful model of a research university for Japanese academia. Existing universities with rigid departmental structures face difficulties in developing new systems to accommodate integrative research and education. An additional challenge is to establish a fully internationalized environment. Aside from the Institute holding lectures in English, the Institute will encourage the use of English as the working language of the graduate university. It is hoped that the infusion of differing cultural mindsets will develop a creative atmosphere that nurtures an original and questing spirit.Thirdly, to stimulate the economic transformation of Okinawa. As Okinawa moves beyond the 30th anniversary of Reversion to Japan (2002), the need to develop a self-sustaining, private-sector-driven economy is clear. As an integral step in this process, the Institute aims jump start the development of an industrial and technological cluster. Okinawa's beautiful natural surroundings and geographical proximity to several East-Asian metropolis provide an ideal setting for a world-class university.",science and technology

OfdjeCwaD-s,"Julio M. Ottino: How Art, Science, and Technology Separated (and May Join Again)","Julio M. Ottino, dean of the McCormick School of Engineering at Northwestern University, speaks to the Northwestern University Women's Board.Abstract:There was a time before science and technology were known by those names. Art, technology, and science formed a continuum, and the modes of thinking enriched each other. The 16th century has many examples of cooperative enterprises between scientists and artists; Galileo Galilei may be clearest case of Italian Renaissance art affecting the course of science. Galileo is also associated with birth of the scientific method, and the scientific method changed everything: science broke company with art, and mixing imagery with analytical thinking became suspect (at least by some). This view is far too narrow -- visual imagination is a central element of scientific imagination. This talk will cover the links between art, technology, and science through time, starting when people had a foot in two camps and when new technologies appeared and the scientific basics of those technologies were still evolving, until reaching examples of the present time. It closes with lessons that can be transferred across domains.",science and technology

BT894WBoRJ8,"Science, Technology, & Society Program: A 21st Century Perspective","The presentation is based upon a recent literature review that intends to highlight some of the critical research that has been synthesized on the perspectives of both teachers and students and their attitudes to teaching and learning in an STS-themed learning environment. The first portion of the presentation draws on the perspectives of elementary and secondary school teachers both locally and abroad. The information collected is intended to illustrate some of the major successes, as well as barriers to implementation in several different classrooms. While much of the research has been focused on the need for additional remedial training for teachers and the use of assessment, the presentation will present data focusing on the overall attitude and educational successes of students that participate in an STS-enriched learning environment. By examining the current research on STS, it is expected that a clear picture will be created demonstrating the place of STS in the overall science curriculum.

In antiquity, independently of Greek philosophers and other civilizations, ancient Chinese philosophers made significant advances in science, technology, mathematics, and astronomy. The first recorded observations of comets, solar eclipses, and supernovae were made in China. Traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture and herbal medicine were also practiced.Among the earliest inventions were the abacus, the ""shadow clock,"" and the first flying machines such as kites and Kongming lanterns. The four Great Inventions of ancient China: the compass, gunpowder, papermaking, and printing, were among the most important technological advances, only known in Europe by the end of the Middle Ages. The Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 906) in particular, was a time of great innovation. A good deal of exchange occurred between Western and Chinese discoveries up to the Qing Dynasty.",science and technology

Access to energy resources will influence and shape the future of human society as we go forward. The cost and availability of energy significantly impacts our quality of life. While most people in industrialized countries have easy access to energy more than two billion people are still relying on solid fuels like wood for cooking and heating. There are also environmental issues to be considered in our efforts for exploration and utilization of new sources of energy. Microwave remote sensing techniques have been very successful for measuring and monitoring many environmentally important terrestrial parameters such as soil moisture, biomass, ocean wind and salinity, etc. However, until recently such techniques have not been exploited for subsurface sensing. In this talk a number of recently developed radar remote sensing techniques will be presented to demonstrate the potential of microwave remote sensing techniques in exploration of fossil fuel resources. A dual frequency synthetic aperture technique will be presented that allows for mapping the sand layer thickness over bedrock to assist with successful seismic tests. Also, a borehole subsurface synthetic aperture imaging concept is presented that facilitates mapping the extent of the subsurface fracking region in shell rock. Monitoring the extent of fracking region is of great importance for optimal utilization of oil/gas wells and to ensure the fracking region is far away from the aquafers.For more lectures on demand visit:http://www.engin.umich.edu/college/in...",science and technology

lATa1bdU3Ec,President Obama Stresses Importance of Science and Technology to the Nation's Future,"On April 29, 2013 -  President Barack Obama reiterated his strong support for science and technology in this speech to members of the National Academy of Sciences at its 150th annual meeting. Science, technology, engineering, and medicine are critical to the nation's prosperity, Obama said, noting that investments made today are bound to pay off for many years to come. The president warned that recent mandatory cuts in federal spending could slow these critical advances in research.  ""With the pace of technological innovation today, we can't afford to stand still for a year or two years or three years,"" Obama said. ""We've got to seize every opportunity we have to stay ahead, and we can't let other countries win the race for ideas and technology of the future."" Just as science and technology have advanced the nation in the past, he noted, they will be critical in addressing today's challenges. ""We will continue to pursue advances in science, engineering, infrastructure, education, and environmental protection, and especially science-based innovations to help us minimize and adapt to global threats like climate change,"" Obama said.President Obama made an impassioned plea to ensure that the nation's young people continue to maintain their spirit of discovery and receive strong educations in STEM.  ""We don't want our kids just to be consumers of the amazing things that science generates,"" Obama said. ""We want them to be producers as well.  We've got to make sure we're supporting that next generation of dreamers and risk takers."" Since Abraham Lincoln signed the congressional charter founding the National Academy of Sciences 150 years ago, the Academy has played a critical role in advancing science and shaping public policy. ""[Lincoln] recognized that finding a way to harness the highest caliber scientific advice for the government would serve a whole range of long-term goals for the nation,"" Obama said, noting that his administration turns to the Academy for advice on many issues.""Like President Lincoln 150 years ago, President Obama clearly understands the importance of S&T to the future prosperity and security of our nation,"" said NAS President Ralph J. Cicerone in introductory remarks. ""We're pleased that President Obama and the administration continue to turn to the National Academy of Sciences for help, analysis, and advice on many issues facing the nation and the world today.""President Obama is the only president to address the National Academy of Sciences' annual gatherings of members twice; he also spoke at the 2009 NAS annual meeting. Other presidents who have addressed the NAS include George H.W. Bush in 1990, John F. Kennedy, who spoke at the NAS Centennial Convocation in 1963 and at the NAS annual meeting in 1961, Jimmy Carter in 1979, and Calvin Coolidge in 1924.The National Academy of Sciences is a private, nonprofit institution that was established under a congressional charter signed by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863.

RxmzCJug9HE,Science and Technology for Supporting Decisions in Natural Disasters | Bijan Khazai | TEDxKIT,"Disasters such as earthquakes, typhoons and floods have devastating impacts on a community’s ability to thrive. Actionable decisions to prepare for, respond to and recover from natural disasters require a personalized understanding of risk. Most existing catastrophe risk assessment models consume huge amounts of time and data and are costly to use. They are commonly applied for assessment of high-value facilities, but numerous small and medium enterprises throughout disaster prone regions typically do not have the capacity and financial means to employ these modeling tools and services. Opening up risk models to a wider community and communicating risk outputs in a way that is useful to ordinary citizens and businesses can play a pivotal role in being better prepared for natural disasters.Dr. Bijan Khazai is a research scientist at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology’s (KIT) Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (CEDIM). He holds Masters and Doctoral degrees in Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering from the University of California at Berkeley, where he worked on developing GIS-based landslide hazard assessment models in the San Francisco Bay Area. Dr. Khazai’s research interests are social vulnerability analysis, megacity and urban risk, and information technology for post-disaster recovery planning. As a project specialist for Earthquake and Megacities Initiative (EMI), he has worked in a number of applied projects in Istanbul, Amman and Metro Manila and Mumbai.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

zO3HZdejf_U,Science & Technology Policy Fellows: Transforming Global Science,"Over the past 40 years, AAAS S&T Policy Fellows have gone on to top leadership posts in U.S. science policy. In a new video, several alumni discuss the program's global impact. In the early 1970s, science-related issues emerged at the center of public debate and at the top of the U.S. political agenda: water and air pollution, energy and nuclear power, the future of the space program. And yet leaders in the U.S. science community, including some at AAAS, realized that Congress and other policy agencies lacked the scientific expertise that would be essential in addressing these issues.To fill the need, they established the AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellowships, and in 1973, seven select scientists and engineers—the first class of Fellows—were dispatched to congressional offices. Over the next four decades, each new year brought a new and bigger class of Fellows. As the years have passed, alumni have risen to high-impact positions in Congress, the White House, the State Department, federal agencies, research universities, and non-governmental organizations.

pRDlSiJVP9o,The Revolution of Science & Technology Since 1945,"Science and Tech Since 1945Have you ever watched a cartoon snowball roll down a hill? It usually picks up snow on its way down, getting larger and larger, before inevitably running over someone. In many ways, the advancement of science and technology since World War II (WWII) has acted a lot like that snowball - out of a few small technological developments and breakthroughs has come even more innovation and new devices which seem to come to market at a faster pace every day. It's how we can go from adding machines the size of an apartment to handheld computers in barely a half century. This lesson will detail some of these mind-boggling advances in the world of science and technology since WWII.CommunicationsCommunications and the dissemination of information is so ubiquitous now that we hardly even realize the constant flow of information hitting us. Prior to WWII, the main form of household communications device most people had in their homes was the radio. Televisions existed, but they were generally very expensive and the programming options were very few. The television exploded in popularity in the 1950s, allowing people to watch important events as they happened in real time.For example, many Americans watched Neil Armstrong's landing on the moon in 1969 from the comfort of their own couch. Likewise, the televised 1953 coronation of Queen Elizabeth II allowed many British residents to see the pomp and circumstance surrounding a royal coronation for the first time.As the decades wore on, television technology became better and better as color televisions largely replaced the original black-and-white sets in the 1970s. Accessories such as video cassette recorders (VCRs) proliferated as screens got larger and the definitions became crisper. In the 1990s, high definition (HD) televisions hit the market which produced a markedly more crisp and vibrant picture than before, though it took approximately a decade before HD televisions became household items in the United States.Telephones also experienced a similarly accelerated increase in use and technological development after WWII. From its invention by Alexander Graham Bell in the late 19th century, the telephone grew increasingly popular and largely replaced the telegraph by WWII, with approximately 30 million phones in service by 1948. After WWII, telephone use continued to expand quickly and by the 1970s over 100 million phones were in use.The next major advancement in telephone communication came in the 1990s with the proliferation of the cellular phone. Though portable and in-vehicle phones had been experimented with since the 1940s, the first true cellular phones (that is, one that pedestrians could carry with them) did not arrive until the 1980s, and even then they were relatively large, clunky objects and were too expensive for the average person. This changed in the 1990s as cell phones got smaller, faster, and cheaper.The proliferation of text messaging in the early 2000s turned the cellular phone into a multi-use tool. The creation of the smartphone, and most notably Apple's iPhone, which essentially turned the cell phone into a computer as well, has completely changed the cell phone, putting access to a world of information on a device which only a couple decades ago was used merely for making telephone calls.TransportationThe world of transportation has seen similar improvements in technology since WWII, though not nearly the same level of innovation. Indeed, our main modes of transportation - automobile, airplane, train, or ship - are still the same, though they have all undergone serious transformations to improve safety and efficiency.The world of automobiles, for example, remained largely unchanged for the first century of its existence, but in the past quarter century, environmental awareness and the high price of oil and gasoline has spurred research and development in cars fueled by alternative sources of fuel. All major auto companies now either have an electric car being developed or on the road, and all have successful gas/electric hybrid models, such as the Toyota Prius or the Ford Fusion Hybrid.Air travel has made more significant advances since WWII with the advent of the jet engine in the 1950s. Prior to the jet engine, all planes were prop-engines, which used large propellers to generate the speed and air flow over the wings necessary for flight. The jet engine provided enormous amounts of thrust, which made the propeller obsolete, though it should be noted many prop planes are still in service today.With the jet engine, planes could now fly farther and faster and carry larger loads. Since WWII commercial air travel has exploded in popularity and safety on airlines has gotten increasingly better - as of this writing in early 2014, the United States' domestic airlines (think Delta, United, or American Airlines) have gone over four years without a major crash.",science and technology

Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings.The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale.

cVAU8WQMrAk,Building bridges between science and society for a better future. | Nadine Bongaerts | TEDxSaclay,"Scientific and technological developments are continuously reshaping our lives. At the same time, it is often difficult to predict beforehand how a new technology will impact society. How do we deal with this uncertainty? In this TEDx talk, Nadine will explain why we need to rethink the intersection between science and society to build a better future.  Nadine Bongaerts is a synthetic biologist who bridges the world of science and technology with business and society. She received her Master Degree in Life Science & Technology from Delft University of Technology and is currently doing her PhD in Synthetic Biology at INSERM in Paris. As a researcher, she uses synthetic biology to develop a novel drug screening method to find new drugs against tuberculosis.Next to her scientific endeavours, she has founded science communication company Biotecture (2011) and the foundation for the Dutch Chapter of the Kairos Society (2012). Kairos supports young social entrepreneurs. Since 2014, she supports the international non-profit Hello Tomorrow as Community Director and is responsible for building a global ecosystem to accelerate innovative technologies to the market.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Why do the world's most cerebral people find it so hard to convey their ideas? And how can we learn to do better? I suggest that answers can be found in a number of ideas from the modern sciences of mind and language. Among them are: The Tree and the Chain (how multidimensional ideas are mapped onto one-dimensional strings); The Curse of Knowledge (why it's so hard to imagine what it's like not to know something you do know); and Long Shadow of Mrs. Grundy (how to distinguish rules of proper usage that are worth keeping from those that are bogus)The first annual Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering lecture about communicating complex scientific and technological subjects clearly and engagingly in the series : Communicating Science and Technology in the 21st Century.Recorded on 9/12/12",science and technology

PPVY1BPYY2o,Postdoc's dorm room at POSTECH (Pohang University of Science and Technology),"This video shows the accommodation (provided at the rate of KRW 200,000 per month) to postdoctoral researchers whose marital status is single. This episode shows most of the amenities and furnishings in the private room. Be sure to watch the other video too, which shows surroundings outside of the private room. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=...)I made this video to show what it looks like because I was never told anything about the accommodation, other than that the university had signed me up for it without my explicit permission. I had no idea about its location, or what it looked like, or anything. This video attempts to give you an idea of what the provided accommodation looks like, including amenities and room furnishing. It should help you in your packing. Since I was told nothing, I did not know what to bring. I will explain the pro's and con's. (In fact, other than being told that the university had automatically signed up for housing, I was not given ANY detail about the accommodation until 2 days before my postdoc contract started. In fact, three days before my contract started, I had received an e-mail stating ""your accommodation hasn't been decided yet.  Tomorrow, the housing office wil let me know. So then i will give you the address."")There was a deposit amount of KRW 300,000.The video shows the content of the room. On the door is an electronic lock system. You can set a personal code to use to unlock the door. It is convenient because you never have to carry a key (other than the key card to get in and out of the building's main entrance). It is big enough to fit the provided furniture (bed, desk, orange chair, refrigerator, wash basin, large closet, small closet). It is not big enough to fit in anything else.At least the room is furnished, but you will have to provide your own bed sheets and pillow.There is not even enough room on the ground to fit in a spare mattress for an overnight visitor (and I suppose this partially explains why the building's policy is to have no overnight guests).What is not clear from this video is that this building (Male dormitory building 19) is in close proximity to other dorm buildings, including freshmen dorms. On any night of the week, at ANY hour, it is likely that very loud, rude, and drunk college students will walk between the buildings and wake you up.Overall, the provided accommodation is extremely bad and shameful for a first-rate university to provide as housing for its postdocs. Should you come here, at least you can use these videos to see what you will get. (The contract which you must sign, which you don't get to see before coming, stipulates that you'll live in the provided accommodation for at least 6 months.)What's also very interesting is that the four nearby high-rise GRADUATE STUDENT APARTMENTS are much nicer than these, with private kitchens, bathrooms, and several bedrooms. I hope the university wisens up and treats us postdocs the way we deserve to be treated.",science and technology

The first portion of the presentation draws on the perspectives of elementary and secondary school teachers both locally and abroad. The information collected is intended to illustrate some of the major successes, as well as barriers to implementation in several different classrooms. While much of the research has been focused on the need for additional remedial training for teachers and the use of assessment, the presentation will present data focusing on the overall attitude and educational successes of students that participate in an STS-enriched learning environment. By examining the current research on STS, it is expected that a clear picture will be created demonstrating the place of STS in the overall science curriculum. The conclusion of the presentation will also aim to indicate disparities still present in the growing body of STS research and areas of future focus.Steven Autieri--Teacher, Science Department, East Haven High School East Haven, CT, USAAidin Amirshokoohi--Science Education Researcher & Curriculum Analyst,Avicenna Institute of Science Teaching & Learning Reading, PA, USA",science and technology

The university often ranks highly among other universities of a similar age.KAIST was established in February 1971 as Korea Advanced Institute of Science, with a loan given by United States Agency for International Development. The university aimed not only to educate young researchers in science and engineering, but also to provide a solid basis for the development of future higher education institutions in Korea.Its structure was created by an international team, which included the American electrical engineer and vice-president of Stanford University Frederick Emmons Terman. Unlike other public institutions in South Korea, KAIST has freedom to decide upon its entry requirements and course structure, which gives the university a special status.Today, KAIST has a rich academic portfolio in disciplines such as physics, mathematics, engineering, humanities and social sciences, business and management. The courses are delivered by 6 colleges and 2 schools, with over 33 divisions. KAIST’s unique institutes include the National NanoFab Center, which conducts research into nano-devices and their potential applications.KAIST consists of 2 major campuses situated in Daejeon and South Korea’s capital Seoul. They offer over 25 dormitories, 4 libraries and a medical centre. To ensure students are actively engaged in the campus cultural events, the university organises traditional opera and jazz recitals.Some of the most famous KAIST former faculty members and graduates are the electrical engineer Soon-dal Choi, mathematician Gi-hyong Gho and the physicist Chang Hee Nam.Subsribe on Happy Traveler - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB7V...",science and technology

af_qq-hX3QM,College Experience Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)  Part 1 of 2,"Click on this link to hear the experience of a student studying at full scholarship in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) pursuing mechanical Engineering. Watch this chat show as Part 1 of 2 videos.Ansh Nasta of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology talks on Chet Chat. Ansh is studying on a full scholarship and is pursuing mechanical engineering. He shares the experience of studying at HKUST.HKUST has modern buildings, it has a very modern large campus, compared to the other Asian universities like NTU, HKU. It has a beautiful campus, right next to the sea so they enjoy both the hilly aspect as well as the seas side aspect. They have a small beach on campus too. They play soccer on the field which is right next to the sea, they sometimes have to jump in and fetch the ball. The residence halls are facing the sea as well, half of them. There are about 2000 students in each year, including 800 students in the Engineering School.One of the big advantages of studying at HKUST is the low cost. HKUST offers many scholarships to students. It doesn’t matter whether you have done IB, ICSE or CBSE, everyone can get a scholarship, only the amounts vary depending upon your grade 11 and Grade 12 marks. There is a page on the website devoted to scholarships for IB students. If you get over 35 out of 45 points in IB you are eligible for a scholarship. If you apply early, a 42 gives you a full scholarship and if you apply regular a 45 gets you a scholarship.The cost is around HKD 120,000 for international students and HKD 40,000 for local students. The government funds each child, whether they are local or international. Even the living costs are very low in Hong Kong – approx. HKD 15,000 – 20,000 per year which is very low.Mechanical Engineering is a tough program. It has an intense workload and courses are offered only once a year so you have to plan your courses in a way that you do not have to take an extra semester at the end of the four years. Mechanical Engineering has the most number of required credits as compared to other degrees.  You need to do 15 credits a semester to complete your requirements. And extra courses if you want to do a minor. Ansh intends to do a minor in business. The mechanical department offers options, you can do three courses in one area to call that your option, he is doing an option in in sustainable energy. There is a lot of flexibility allowed. HKUST has a core requirement of 36 courses out of the required 120. These include math, comp science, history, science and technology – any field or any major. The course allows you to take any course as long as you fulfil the requirements of that course.Ansh enjoyed a course in history in his first year and last summer he took a course in bitcoins that he thoroughly enjoyed. That was his favourite class. Discussion based class with external speakers was interesting.The activities that he is engaged in outside the classroom are diverse – he is the financial secretary of the art club, the internal secretary of the cuisine society.  He works with the sustainability unit, as part of the sustainability leadership program at his school he is working on a solar panel project and is now a mentor for students pursuing projects in sustainable energy. He also trains with the school track and field team and runs long distance running like 5 kms and cross country. He also plays football for the mech engineering team. He tries lots of new sports like kickboxing. HKUST has an Undergraduate research orientation program which is considered one of the best in Asia. They have a lot of funding from the government and infrastructure available to do research. Ansh has been pursuing research for the past one year under a professor on Energy harvesting.HKUST (UST) has really good sport infrastructure too, they have a football field, running track near the sea, an indoor football court too, 8 tennis courts, squash courts, badminton courts, indoor gym, table tennis tables, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, multi purpose hall for martial arts.  Student body is international compared to the Asian universities. 80% of the students are local Hong Kong students since it is government funded, 10% are mainland china students. 10% of the student body is international. This largely includes Philipines, Indonesia, Taiwan, Korea, India students but in recent years they have had lots of Europeans and Americans coming in for the experience. There are students from all around the world. Also the 80% Hong Kong students are diverse. They could be from all over the world but grew up in Hong Kong and are classified as Hong Kong Locals.Please Watch Part 2 of 2 coming soonVideo Chat with Ansh NastaHost - Chetna VasishthWe are on -YouTube.com/c/ChetChatFacebook.com/chetchat101Twitter - @chetchat101Instagram - chetchat101Google.com/+/ChetChatchetchat101@gmail.comchetchat101.tumblr.com vimeo.com/chetchataffimity.com/u/chetchat",science and technology

PzPW5msevJ0,15 Recent Science Discoveries You Wont Believe,"15 amazing recent discoveries in the world of science and here they are from bionic contact lenses to reanimating dinosaur dna!Subscribe to Talltanic http://goo.gl/wgfvrr7.  New Human SpeciesBiologists all over the world were intrigued upon hearing the 2015 discovery of a new species of human, Homo Naledi, allowing for an ever clearer picture of our ancient ancestry.  The findings were unveiled deep in an underground cave in South Africa and is considered one of the greatest collection of human remains ever unearthed.  So far, it is known that this species of human grew to an average height of 5 feet and had a brain no larger than an orange.  The way the bones in the South African cave were arranged suggests that these human ancestors ritualistically buried their dead, giving scientists a glimpse into our cultural past.6.  Bionic LensWhile still in the testing stage, the founder of Ocumetics Technology Corp may have stumbled upon a revolutionary technology that could augment the way humans perceive the world.  A new bionic contact lens will give wearers an ability to see the world with stronger than 20/20 vision.  Some subjects, who have already tried the lens themselves, claim that they not only see better than ever before but have identified a unique spectrum of colors unfamiliar to the unaided eye.  Is this perhaps the first step in the direction of a new era of superhumans?5.  Harder Than Diamond Scientists may have recently discovered a substance harder than diamond, Q-carbon.  What gives diamonds their excellent hardness are the chemical bonds that hold them together.  The carbon in diamonds is held together by incredibly tight chemical bonds at the microscopic level, giving diamonds their prominent hardness.  By the manipulation of carbon atoms, scientists were able to augment their chemical bonds, producing a material that is potentially 60 times harder than diamond.  While this substance is still being experimented on, it is a potential prospect for the future of cheap, efficient technologies.4.  First MammalsResearchers from the University of Edinburgh have discovered an ancient species of mammals that survived the notorious extinction of the dinosaurs over 65 million years ago.  The reason this find is so significant is that it gives us a glimpse at how mammals began to rule the world previously dominated by their cold-blooded counterparts.  The mammal is thought to have been a plant-eater closely resembling a modern beaver.  Once the dinosaurs were eliminated these beaver-like creatures began to flourish, given that they were no longer victims of dinosaur predators.  Because these little guys were able to withstand the destruction that wrecked havoc on the dinosaurs, an array of mammals, including our ancestors, were finally able to leave their mark on the world. 3.  Whale Gene MappingGene mapping is starting to look less like a theoretical nicety and more like an applied science with this new aquatic discovery.  Scientists have finally discovered why Bowhead Whales are able to live to 200 years old by remapping their entire genome.  By comparing the genome of Bowhead Whales with the genome of other mammals with a less impressive lifespan, scientists were able to point out marked differences.  Bowhead longevity is due to its genes’ effectiveness in repairing gene deterioration, which is the cause of cancer and other ailments known to cut human life short.  By further studying this animal’s genes, scientists may finally be able to restore our own faulty genetic system, substantially lengthening our lives. 2.  Second Earth NASA has recently confirmed their discovery of a possible second Earth.  Kepler-452b orbits its sun in what scientists call the “Goldilocks Zone,” which is the habitable region in space, not too far or close to the sun, necessary for the possibility of life to flourish.  The new planet appears to have a rocky surface as well as liquid water, which is another key ingredient for life to subsist.  Although not much is known about if there is life beyond Earth, it makes sense to take notice of planets similar to our own.1.  Animal Re-animationScientists have always been intrigued by the prospect of re-animating creatures that have been extinct for many years.  While bringing a dinosaur back to life would be kind of cool, bringing a Wooly Mammoth back to life would be just as cool, and that is just what scientists are trying to do.  Because Wooly Mammoths and Saber-Toothed Tigers have only been extinct for tens of thousands of years, unlike the millions of years dinosaurs have been extinct, intact DNA samples are much easier to find.  Scientists believe it is possible to recreate these extinct beasts by cloning them with DNA and tissue samples, which have been found, over the years, preserved in ice.",science and technology

I will argue that that the neglect of research and innovation in India risks its economic growth and social development. Further, I will use data to illustrate India’s performance in research and the various deficiencies in India’s research ecosystem. The data will shed light on productivity of Indian researchers, interest in research in India, research institutions’ performance, collaboration among Indian scientists and industry involvement. This will form the basis of policy suggestions on improving India’s research ecosystem.

LHtseplPqO4,Electronic Sackbut Synthesizer - Canada Museum of Science and Technology,"Hugh LeCaine of Ottawa created the Electronic Sackbut Synthesizer in his home studio over a period of three years from 1945 to 1948. This synthesizer is the first voltage-controlled synthesizer ever built, preceding the manufacture of commercial synthesizers by twenty years. Le Caine, a nuclear physicist with the National Research Council, was passionate about music. He was concerned that the musical notes produced by electronic instruments in the 1930s, such as the Hammond Organ and the Morse Robb Wave Organs, lacked a certain expressivity. Determined to shape technology for the needs of the musician and expand the possibilities of musical sound he built a synthesizer that allows for complex variations in pitch and tone. This, LeCaine achieved, through the innovative use of voltage control. The technique provides an automatic background voltage that can remain stable or be altered through the manipulation of the knobs and keyboard. The keys are sensitive to a vertical pressure that controls the volume and a lateral pressure that changes the pitch. In this way the musician can simultaneously manipulate the volume, pitch, and timbre of each note and produce gradual transitions from one sound to the next. The rudimentary appearance of the synthesizer  its three legs made of crossed pieces of scrap wood and with instructions penciled onto its surface  camouflages the brilliant concept behind this invention. LeCaine's Electronic Sackbut Synthesizer is the precursor of today's electronic instruments.",science and technology

X5fhVLJs9go,William Johnson | Science and Technology of Metallic Glasses,"Metallic glasses are vitrified metal alloys – liquid alloys that solidify without crystallizing. Like silicate glasses and thermoplastic polymers, they exhibit a glass transition below which the liquid freezes to a solid that resists shear on practical time scales. Bulk metallic glasses developed over the past two decades, exhibit unique thermal, mechanical, and magnetic properties that make them an attractive choice for numerous engineering applications. Their glassy nature opens processing and manufacturing opportunities normally associated with plastics technology. The speaker will survey the scientific and technological evolution of metallic glasses from their inception to the present time. He will describe how metallic glass technology offers unique opportunities to change the way metals are used and commercial metal products are manufactured.William L. Johnson, the Ruben and Donna Mettler Professor of Materials Science at Caltech, joined the Caltech faculty in 1977. He received his B.A. in physics from Hamilton College and his Ph.D. in applied physics from Caltech. He spent two years at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center (1975-77) prior to joining the faculty at Caltech.Professor Johnson's research interests are centered on non-equilibrium thermodynamic systems. His research advisor was Pol Duwez, the inventor of metallic glass. In the mid-1980's, he, along with Ricardo Schwarz, discovered solid-state amorphization, leading to many years of fruitful research. His research accomplishments include the first studies of superconductivity in metallic glasses, pioneering studies of crystal to glass transformations (see Progress in Materials Science, 30, 81-134 (1986)) and seminal work on the application of thermodynamics to ion beam induced modifications of materials (Nucl. Instr. & Methods, B7, 657 (1985)).This work was followed by the synthesis of nanocrystalline and amorphous materials by high energy ball milling, and, in 1993, the discovery of bulk metallic glasses. Professor Johnson has pioneered the discovery, characterization and science of bulk metallic glass forming alloys and their use as engineering materials (see, for example, Applied Phys. Letters, 63, 2342 (1993)). His recent work has involved the development of a theory that establishes fundamental physical principles governing flow in amorphous materials. His research group is continuing to discover new bulk metallic glass forming alloys employing both experimental methods and molecular dynamic simulations to predict potential glass-forming candidates.The discovery of new glass-forming alloys cascades into a chain of scientific investigations, including the measurement of thermal, mechanical, optical, electrical and viscous properties; fundamental research into the kinetics of crystallization and glass formation, and improving the properties of monolithic bulk metallic glass through the fabricaiton of intrinsically and extrinsically toughened composites.His research has lead to commercial success, too. He is an inventor on over 25 issued patents. He is a cofounder of Liquidmetal Technologies, in Lake Forrest California, which commercialized one of Professor Johnson's BMG alloys for golf club heads (under the company name ""LiquidMetal Golf""). The company is now pursuing opportunities in cases for electronic devices. They are also expanding into the defense industry, as some of the BMG composites have demonstrated properties superior to depleted uranium as high-velocity penetrators.Professor Johnson served on the editorial board of the Journal of Rapid Solidification, and serves currently as an associate editor for Journal of Applied Physics, and Applied Physics Letters. He is a principal editor of the MRS Journal of Material Science. He is author or co-author of over 230 publications in the scientific literature, and has contributed chapters to seven books. He has held numerous consulting positions for the Department of Energy, NASA, and corporations. Over the past two decades, he has been a consultant and on numerous advisory panels for the U.S. Department of Energy, NASA, the National Science Foundation, and the National Academy of Engineering.http://www.eas.caltech.edu/people/306...",science and technology

d6dxWNQj1GU,Most AMAZING Recent Technology!,"Check out the most amazing recent technology! This top 10 list of recent futuristic inventions and cool gadgets from the future is absolutely amazing!  Subscribe For New Videos! http://goo.gl/UIzLeBWatch our ""Most INCREDIBLE Coin Discoveries Around The World!"" video here: https://youtu.be/_BcTxPHP6GwWatch our ""Most AMAZING Places Around The World!"" video here: https://youtu.be/a3l6iREKgAkWatch our ""Most Amazing Cities Found UNDERWATER!"" video here: https://youtu.be/rUqxhYJqGhU#12 3D Printing Organs3D printing has been around for a few years now, but it just recently made breakthroughs bigger than cars or phone cases or toys that have been created before. The 3D printer has started created organs for human use. Sure, prosthetics are understandable. But organs? Research is currently being conducted on artificial heart, kidney, and liver structures, as well as other major organs. Organs like the heart will be tougher but it is definitely possible. Can you imagine being the person that kept organs in stock? Checking your list...okay I need to print three kidneys and four livers today. The reason the 3D printing works so well is that organs are very complicated and the machine does a layer by layer scan of an actual organ. This allows them to give a very detailed printout.Crazy yes. But not as crazy as the ability to print out human skin! Now that craziness is happening as we speak! This can be to repair damaged skin or purely cosmetic reasons. #11 Needleless Vaccines What is your least favorite part of getting flu shots? Oh yeah, the shot. The needle that pierces your skin and stings.This new invention called the ImmunoMatrix patch will allow you to vaccinate yourself with a simple band-aid like patch. This isn’t just great because it’s painless but has even greater benefits. One: It takes a tenth of the vaccine that the syringe does, which saves tons of money. And two: it doesn’t require the glass vial, syringes, hypodermic needles, trained medical personnel, and biohazardous waste disposal. So again, it saves tons and tons of money.Can you imagine it being flu season and you just going to town to pick up your flu patch and adhering it at home? Dream big…and realistically! This is happening.#10 Endless StorageYou know how a terabyte is really big? Well what about a million terabytes? Maybe a trillion? Okay, now imagine an endless amount of storage! Scientists at the University of Southampton have created and are working on advances with this technology. Not only will this device store endless info, but it is pretty much invincible to damage.It is made out of nanostructured glass and has the ability to record and retrieve five dimensional digital data by femtosecond laser writing.As for right now, it can only hold about 360 TB, but things are quickly escalating there. It can go through almost 2000 degrees Fahrenheit and will last longer than anyone on this planet…except maybe the tardigrade. The technology isn’t for public  use yet because it is reserved for preserving historical documents first, since it can hold an entire library of books! They have already stored actual copies of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Newton’s Opticks, Magna Carta and Kings James Bible. #9 Wall Climbing FishEver seen a spider climb a wall? What about a monkey? Hmm…well, what about a wall climbing fish?In the Amazon rain forest, just recently, a wall climbing fish has been discovered. This may not seem like a scientific advancement, but in reality, it means everything! This isn’t the only thing odd about these fish, who were oddly enough born in caves only they could see and we’re colorless! This Ecuadorian fish defies gravity as it hikes up a nearly vertical wall for ten feet!It’s called a Chaetostoma microps, and is a suckermouth armoured catfish. You’ve seen suckerfish climb underwater, but out of water is a whole new thing! Scientists are ecstatic to study the technique and maybe use it to create wall climbing gear for engineers. Another thing that makes this discovery an advancement is that it has never been seen in this exact way before. Meaning, it has either learned the ability on its own, as a species, or…there are still many more species still undiscovered by scientists. #8 Cybernetic ImplantsThe term cyberware is a pretty new field for scientists. Sure, the first pacer was implanted in the 1950s, but that was such a small advancement compared to today. We already have an “artificial pancreas” for diabetics. As of now, it is simply a pod implants into the skin by the wearer and pumps insulin into their body. But you see, there are two types of cyberware today.  Brainware and bodyware. You know the datajack from The Matrix? Yeah, like that.  Origins Explained is the place to be to find all the answers to your questions, from mysterious events and unsolved mysteries to everything there is to know about the world and its amazing animals!",science and technology

tQd_5as_cMY,"Humans, Gods and Technology - VPRO documentary - 2017","What will our world look like 25 years from now? Watch this lecture about the meaning of life shaped by technology in a near future.Nobody knows how our world will look like in 25 years. Perhaps our work is taken over by autonomous robots and we become the slaves of the technology we have created ourselves. The big questions about the future of man and his relation to technology are presented to two important thinkers of the moment: Kevin Kelly and Yuval Noah Harari.Kevin Kelly is a writer of influential works such as What Technology Wants and The Inevitable. Kelly sketches the inevitability of technology and even sees technology as an autonomous evolutionary system. Artificial intelligence becomes commonplace for everyone and will help us analyze difficult issues and challenge them to reflect on who we are. Kelly is convinced that we are already seen as Gods by technology and that robots will also believe in their own Gods.Yuval Noah Harari is a writer of books about the history of Homo Sapiens and Homo Deus. Harari sketches the history of tomorrow and analyzes the way in which we create our own illusions; illusory institutions such as religion, states and money. We believe in gods because we want to be them ourselves. Harari sees a society with inequalities where some people can upgrade themselves to gods and others will remain vulnerable and mortal.Originally broadcasted by VPRO in 2017.© VPRO Backlight October 2017On VPRO broadcast you will find nonfiction videos with English subtitles, French subtitles and Spanish subtitles, such as documentaries, short interviews and documentary series.VPRO Documentary publishes one new subtitled documentary about current affairs, finance, sustainability, climate change or politics every week.

When looking to develop business and management skills, engineers and scientists are faced with an unfortunate decision between two choices: hope there's some day given a chance to develop leadership abilities on the job or to get an MBA and risk losing touch with their technical roots.  At UC Santa Barbara we've created a third choice--a better choice.  The UC Santa Barbara's Master of Technology Management Program was built with chief one important goal: to catapult early career engineers toward becoming leaders in technology ventures, both within established companies and startups.  To build the Master of Technology Management Program we asked dozens of large technology companies like Google, Facebook, Oracle, Tesla, JDS Uniphaseas well as founders of many small tech startups what skills engineers and scientists need to become successful entrepreneurs and effective change agents within large firms then we carefully crafted a curriculum that help students to develop those skills in just nine months. Our Master of Technology Management Program is geared specifically to teach students about how to lead technical ventures both new companies and established technology companies.We focus with laser precision on thinking about how do you manage technical enterprise and technical workers.  The MTM curriculum provides the frameworks and skills that will allowyou to comfortably tack between start-up activities within established companies and start-up activities as an entrepreneur.  Our program focuses on the intersection of Technology Management where people products and processes meet.  Work is all about collaboration. Very few things are individual effort the hardest projects we do at Sonos are around getting the highly cross functional teams working and collaborating well together. That was a huge skill I learned at UCSB.  Our award-winning faculty is composed of nationally recognized scholars andteachers in the field of technology management who have invested in, founded, lead and consulted for tech ventures.  Their real-world experiences allow them to speak directly to issues that students will face in their jobs.  Our core faculty is fully committed to the development of our Master of Technology Management students. That means office hours, extracurricular events, even hallway conversations are centered on you and your classmates.  We accept only the most talented and highly qualified early career engineers and scientists from around the world.  We look for individuals who have distinguished themselves as technology experts and have demonstrated leadership potential.  You'll be moving through the nine-month intensive curriculum as a single cohort with smart, ambitious individuals just like you.  UC Santa Barbara's technology management program is the only management program in the world designed exclusively for engineers and scientists.  If your ideal career path is one in which you build technology,  focus leadership skills on top of your existing technical talents,  this is the program for you.  Today's tech companies are looking for tomorrow's leaders.  Will you be ready to meet the demand?  To learn more or to submit an application, visit us at mtm.ucsb.edu today.",science and technology

In this excellent new documentary Kingdoms of Sumeria ‘The Legacy of Sumerian Scientists’ we take on some of the biggest enigmas of the Sumerians, in our journey so far. Many will know of certain Sumerian and Babylonian scientific curiosities and their inventions, but what is the origins of these scientific endeavours? Astonishing evidence now shows Sumerian science was high, it was preserved in later cultures, and it was unprecedented. Kingdoms of Sumeria were vast domains all connected through a trade network, which in this episode is shown through the Sumerian Science Endeavours. The most insightful of all is the roots in Armenia, which many scholars shy away from.© Nabonidus Media",science and technology

It connects people in high-quality networks that deliver value for money and opportunities to excel. This is a flexible and open approach focused on cooperation, which creates a unique dynamic. It creates a fertile ground for science to flourish. Academia, industry, public and private sector laboratories work together in networks, sharing knowledge, leveraging diversity and pooling resources.COST is now more relevant than ever.

pgX3JtwboEc,Shay Locomotive - Canada Museum of Science and Technology,"The Shay Geared Steam Locomotive, one of one hundred and sixteen known to remain worldwide (another five questionable and another six Willamette style Shays), was originally conceived by the American lumber merchant Ephraim Shay. The patent was sold to Lima Machine Works (eventually Locomotive Works Inc.) of Lima, Ohio who refined the concept and produced 2,768 Shays over a period of 67 years (1878-1945). The museum's Shay is composed of parts from two locomotives, one constructed in 1923, and the other in 1925. Both were constructed for the Merrill & Ring Lumber Co., Ltd and used in forestry operations at Theodosia Arm, British Columbia. The Shay was branded as the ""strong man of the woods"" because of its distinctive and unique mechanical workings, making it highly efficient in the logging industry. Immediately noticeable is the Shay's offset boiler to the left, positioned there in order to make room for the three cylinder engine mounted vertically on the right. The engine's pistons turn the crank shaft which is connected on both ends by universal and slip joints to the line shafts on the front and rear trucks. These transmit power to both axles on each truck by way of bevel gearing. Thus, all wheels are driven and produce tractive  or pulling  force of 22,580 pounds (10, 242 Kg), allowing the Shay to move along the steep grades of British Columbia's mountainous terrain while hauling substantial loads. With its flexible (pivoting and rotating) trucks, extra wide tires on each wheel and all axles powered design, the Shay Geared Steam Locomotive was able to negotiate the unrefined forestry railways that would easily stop or derail a conventional rod locomotive.",science and technology

Eo76-SX5Bck,College Experience Hong Kong University of Science and Technology - Part 2 of 2,"Click on this link to hear the experience of a student studying at full scholarship in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) pursuing mechanical Engineering. Watch this chat show as Part 2 of 2 videos.Ansh Nasta of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology talks on Chet Chat. Ansh is studying on a full scholarship and is pursuing mechanical engineering. He shares the experience of studying at HKUST.Coming to Jobs, another advantage of studying in Hong Kong is availability of Jobs, visa, internships etc. Ansh says that jobs in Hong Kong pay a lot, some students can pay their living expenses because of a well-paying job. Most common part time job for students is to become a tutor for other IB students, and this is very well paying and helps take care of boarding and living expenses.The language requirement for most jobs is English, though they prefer if you know Cantonese. However, there are many students who have well-paying jobs without knowing Chinese. It is very easy to get a work visa once you have studied there, also the job placements are very good. Most international students have job offers in hand a few months before they graduate and very good salaries.Intense research culture, jobs being available, salaries being good, visas being easily available and cost being low make it a very attractive place to study in.Asian culture is unique and different from the American and British universities. They are very academic and it is very difficult to score good grades. Students are graded on a curve and it is very tough to get a GPA over 3.0. The Chinese students spend most of their time studying and for them university is about studying. If they pursue any activity they will take up only one activity and pursue it very seriously. They are much focussed.There is no fraternity culture, there are clubs and societies, though international students are not welcome for most of these. The language is mostly in Chinese. At the Business school lectures are discussion based. In Engineering school there are less international professors, there are more Chinese professors. In their culture subordination is key. Professors at the top, students below. So you are not supposed to question a professor in class. If you give the right answer in class, they think you are showing off. Students don’t like to speak in class.Language of Instruction is English, but given 80% Cantonese. Most activities are conducted in Cantonese like clubs, movie nights, trekking activities etc. are all conducted in Cantonese. Most students have learnt English but they find it very difficult to speak in English since English is either their second or third language. So they prefer sticking amongst themselves. Even if they know how to speak in English they are very reluctant, since in their culture if you make a mistake people make fun of you, so they are afraid that the international students will make fun of them so they prefer to speak in Cantonese.Ansh started learning Cantonese to merge with them, and that made a big difference since they found an international student is trying to learn Cantonese and trying to speak with us, they get more friendly with you. Even with sports, may Indian students do not participate in sports, they are usually more involved in partying or studying. Ansh is one of the few international students who is serious about his extra curriculars. Even mainland Chinese students have always studied in Mandarin so most of them learn English just before coming to college, just to get admission.The food on campus is local Chinese food that is not very spicy. Food places outside campus can be quite expensive. Ansh travelled around Hong Kong researching good food less than HKD 50 or 100. HE enjoyed the food since Hong Kong is a very diverse place for food, a huge varieties of cuisines. He now tries to cook his own food and became the director of the cuisine society to initiate more activities with people who are as passionate about food.The social scene on campus is also very different. Their idea of partying is not drinking and dancing but playing games and eating good food. So most International students go out for partying. In Hong Kong the two main partying areas are Wanchai and Lan Kwan Fong, both have a very international feel, where many international students party. Hiking is a great fun activity in Hong Kong. You can hike in the middle of the city, in five minutes you can be from a station to a mountain. There are hiking trails and maps available which make hiking a great activity in Hong Kong.  ‘Crazy’ is the one word in which he describes his school – crazy academic and crazy diverse.

kBgXnjEpD7M,Naked Science - Roman Tech,"Subscribe to Naked Science - http://goo.gl/wpc2Q1Every other Wednesday we present a new video, so join us to see the truth laid bare...What did the Romans do for us?They invented the modern world.  Modern cities, modern warfare, modern living all first came together in ancient Rome.  The Romans were the first superpower, controlling around a quarter of the world’s population.  This film looks at how they used technology to hold together their empire.  We see the ingenious pilum, a spear cleverly designed so that the enemy couldn’t throw it back; the scorpion, a bolt-firing weapon of war; and the rock-hurling ballista, the fore-runner of modern artillery.We learn how they built their roads, the arteries of the empire that, put end to end, would stretch twice around the world.  Roman cities, with their grid pattern, paved the way for the cities of today.  They had hot baths, central heating, flushing toilets and double-glazing.  They built apartment blocks 8 stories high, and to entertain their citizens built stunning buildings like the Pantheon and Colosseum (or Coliseum).  But holding everything together at the heart of the Empire, was water.  No city can survive without a supply of drinking water.  Great aqueducts carried water into Rome from springs 11 miles away.  When the planners of New York were building their water system, they travelled to Italy to copy the Romans.",science and technology

FRQnL2IWCXk,Fifty Years of Chinese Science and Technology,"Prof. Geoff Oldham reflects on his experiences over fifty years, starting with this first visit to the Chinese mainland in October 1964 when he wrote in Science magazine of “the beginning of the Chinese scientific revolution”. He recalls decades of collaborative work between SPRU and Chinese institutions through the 1970s and 80s, including research conducted on technology transfer in the oil industry and in the area of ‘clean coal technologies’, links between provincial level research and policy making, and his contributions to policy evaluations in the 1980s and 1990s that saw him working alongside Chinese and international colleagues and reporting directly to the Minister of Science and Technology. Tracing China’s changing science and technology policies from the early focus on self-reliance to the ‘catching up’ of the reform and opening period that paved the way for China’s emerging leadership and current patterns of international collaboration, his talk charts the country’s ongoing transformation and the changing role of science and technology within it. It alsos provide an account reflecting on personal memories that have shaped Professor Oldham’s perspectives on this process. The talk was part of the China Sussex Seminar Series http://www.sussex.ac.uk/newsandevents...",science and technology

Part fact and part fiction, the timeline is based on detailed research – including analysis of current trends, long-term environmental changes, advances in technology such as Moore's Law, future medical breakthroughs, the evolving geopolitical landscape and much more. Where possible, references have been provided to support the predictions. FutureTimeline is an ongoing, collaborative project that is open for discussion – we welcome ideas from scientists, futurists, inventors, writers and anyone else interested in futurology.Why robots won’t take over the earth – or your job“All of the forecasts you can find about Earth 2050 could become a reality in just a couple of decades. Earth 2050 is not only a creative exercise for us. For the last 20 years, Kaspersky Lab experts have been fighting with cybercrime, and they have seen threats evolving over this time. They are therefore able to share their knowledge and expertise and – in many cases – encourage users to take a more thorough look at the security of future technologies,” said Andrey Lavrentyev, head of technology research department .“Although inventions might be amazing – such as like driverless cars, intelligent infrastructure and the ability to instantly share medical data between doctors across the world – they can still trip us up. Each of them brings a whole new world of opportunity for cyber criminals to exploit.”At the moment Earth 2050 contains predictions for 80 cities around the globe. Users can select any of these cities and forecasts will appear at the top of the map.The portal is divided into three time categories: 2030, 2040 and 2050, with each of these containing predictions from people who are recognised experts in their fields.The forum is not limited to written predictions. Earth 2050 also contains 12 VR-enabled panoramas of cities like Barcelona and Shanghai as well as illustrations of different artefacts from the future. The future of connectivity and delivery Users can take a 360º look at how future cities might be operating. Will we be able to adjust the appearance of every person we see in the street?Will humans invent a dress that changes its style? Are driverless cars in smart cities the future of the taxi business? Will we see ads while we sleep? These questions are just a glimpse of what a user can find on the site.Filling in a special feedback form allows visitors to add their own ideas to the portal. These will be published once they have passed through the editorial team’s review. Users can discuss existing predictions and also contribute by sharing their own.New content from the experts, and forecasts compiled from different sources, will frequently appear on the site. “Still, we hope to see many more names on the portal and encourage our users and site visitors to send us their craziest ideas on what the future might look like,” Andrey Lavrentyev mentioned.Manchester is a vibrant city region and hub for the North of England. But with a population of nearly 2.8 million and a growing city economy, urban traffic congestion is becoming a major issue and challenge, especially when multiple city events take place on the same day.Cisco and its partners, Purple, Proxama, Movement Strategies, Transport for Greater Manchester and Sustainable Environment Ltd are pleased to announce that they have been awarded a grant from InnovateUK to deliver a proof of concept solution that will enable Transport for Greater Manchester to better address the challenge of providing transport services to fit demand.The CitySpire proof of concept will see the development of context-aware location-based services, built on anonymised data from multiple sources, including Bluetooth Low Energy and Wi-Fi net.Interpretation and analysis of that data will enable CitySpire to present groups of passengers to flexible and shared demand-responsive transport company, Simply Connect.The initiative will aim to prove the value of an enhanced booking capability not currently available to existing popular ride-sharing services, such as UberPool and BlaBlaCar.Facebook- https://www.facebook.com/Bakchodiwala...website   - http://bakchodiwalatech.blogspot.in/Email- ammymalhi63@gmail.comInstagram- https://www.instagram.com/amritpal_si...Twitter - https://twitter.com/BCwalaTechCopyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for ""fair use"" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

The first smart glasses are projected to be available in the summer to fall of 2012 with other companies potentially releasing their versions by the end of 2012. Smart glasses will incorporate a bright high-definition display, adjustable for outdoor use on the glass lens so that the images appear as if they were in the exterior world.

Using two monochromatic IR cameras and three infrared LEDs, the device observes a roughly hemispherical area, to a distance of about 1 meter (3 feet). The LEDs generate a 3D pattern of dots of IR light[14] and the cameras generate almost 300 frames per second of reflected data, which is then sent through a USB cable to the host computer, where it is analyzed by the Leap Motion controller software using ""complex math"" in a way that has not been disclosed by the company, in some way synthesizing 3D position data by comparing the 2D frames generated by the two cameras.[15][16]The smaller observation area and higher resolution of the device differentiates the product from the Kinect, which is more suitable for whole-body tracking in a space the size of a living room.[17] In a demonstration to CNET, The Leap was shown to perform tasks such as navigating a website, using pinch-to-zoom gestures on maps, high-precision drawing, and manipulating complex 3D data visualizations.[17] Leap Motion CEO Michael Buckwald told CNET:Leap Motion initially distributed thousands of units to developers who are interested in creating applications for the device. The Leap Motion controller was first shipped in July, 20133)3D printing :-3D printing or Additive manufacturing[1] is a process of making a three-dimensional solid object of virtually any shape from a digital model. 3D printing is achieved using an additive process, where successive layers of material are laid down in different shapes.[2] 3D printing is also considered distinct from traditional machining techniques, which mostly rely on the removal of material by methods such as cutting or drilling (subtractive processes).A 3D printer is a limited type of industrial robot that is capable of carrying out an additive process under computer control.While 3D printing technology has been around since the 1980s, it was not until the early 2010s that the printers became widely available commercially.[3] The first working 3D printer was created in 1984 by Chuck Hull of 3D Systems Corp.[4] Since the start of the 21st century there has been a large growth in the sales of these machines, and their price has dropped substantially.[5] According to Wohlers Associates, a consultancy, the market for 3D printers and services was worth $2.2 billion worldwide in 2012, up 29% from 2011.[6]The 3D printing technology is used for both prototyping and distributed manufacturing with applications in architecture, construction (AEC), industrial design, automotive, aerospace, military,4)transparent phone :-processor - which is said to be faster than the current Apple A4 processor.

V66feYKy6_A,"Stephen Hawking: Science & Technology Lecture, Interview - Education (1998)","Stephen William Hawking CH CBE FRS FRSA (born 8 January 1942) is an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, author and director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology within the University of Cambridge. His books: https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=U...His scientific works include a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity, and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation. Hawking was the first to set forth a cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He is a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.Hawking is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, a lifetime member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States. Hawking was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge between 1979 and 2009.Hawking has achieved success with works of popular science in which he discusses his own theories and cosmology in general; his book A Brief History of Time stayed on the British Sunday Times best-seller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks.Hawking suffers from a rare early-onset slow-progressing form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease or Lou Gehrig's disease, that has gradually paralysed him over the decades. He communicates using a single cheek muscle attached to a speech-generating device. Hawking married twice and has three children.At the release party for the home video version of the A Brief History of Time, Leonard Nimoy, who had played Spock on Star Trek, learned that Hawking was interested in appearing on the show. Nimoy made the necessary contact, and Hawking played a holographic simulation of himself in an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation in 1993.[306][307][308] The same year, his synthesiser voice was recorded for the Pink Floyd song ""Keep Talking"",[309][234] and in 1999 for an appearance on The Simpsons.[310] Hawking appeared in documentaries entitled The Real Stephen Hawking (2001),[296] Stephen Hawking: Profile (2002) [311] and Hawking (2013), and the documentary series Stephen Hawking, Master of the Universe (2008).[312] Hawking has also guest-starred in Futurama[72] and The Big Bang Theory.[313] Hawking allowed the use of his trademarked voice in the biographical 2014 film The Theory of Everything.[314]Hawking has used his fame to advertise products, including a wheelchair,[296] National Savings,[315] British Telecom, Specsavers, Egg Banking[316] and Go Compare.[317]Hawking has received numerous awards and honours. Already early in the list, in 1974 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS). At that time, his nomination read:     ""Hawking has made major contributions to the field of general relativity. These derive from a deep understanding of what is relevant to physics and astronomy, and especially from a mastery of wholly new mathematical techniques. Following the pioneering work of Penrose he established, partly alone and partly in collaboration with Penrose, a series of successively stronger theorems establishing the fundamental result that all realistic cosmological models must possess singularities. Using similar techniques, Hawking has proved the basic theorems on the laws governing black holes: that stationary solutions of Einstein's equations with smooth event horizons must necessarily be axisymmetric; and that in the evolution and interaction of black holes, the total surface area of the event horizons must increase. In collaboration with G. Ellis, Hawking is the author of an impressive and original treatise on ""Space-time in the Large"".

Y6zDhH160Wg,Technology vs Modern Science,"Go to UniversalModel.com to learn more.From Volume I of  Universal Model, A New Millennial Science, on page 57 we find the following difference between Science and Technology:""Scientific leaders recognize the difficulty in getting the public excited over natural science but they also understand the importance of gaining their support. Popularity drives the funding for new research, a multi-billion dollar proposition in America today. How do you convince the public to fund unpopular theoretical research? Over the past several decades, there has been a growing trend to group science and technology into the generic category of ‘science.’ This largely successful effort has effectively blurred the line between them and few people recognize their important differences. One difference remains significant—science has not enjoyed the success that technology has.We recognize one example in the bestselling American science magazine, Scientific American. During the last two decades, it has become increasingly difficult for science journals and magazines to fill their pages with purely scientific discoveries and stories to maintain readership. On the other hand, technological journals and magazines have grown exponentially, graced with abundant technological discoveries and stories. Scientific American recognized this, and several years ago, the magazine announced to its readers it was changing its format to include new sections dedicated to technology.""In one instance, they presented twenty World Changing Ideas in the December 2009 issue, to “build a cleaner, healthier, smarter world” (page 50). Of the twenty ideas, only three were science-based. The remaining seventeen were technology-based. This ratio of 3/20 science-based ideas is probably typical of the science-verses-technology circumstance that exists today. There are many more successful technological inventions than there are new scientific discoveries. Most new scientific discoveries (such as those in astronomy and biology) are often a direct result of technological advances in telescopes, DNA testing, and other equipment and procedures. Often times, these new techno-related discoveries contradict existing theories, a topic we approach in later chapters.  In another text, the “power of science” is mingled with “technologies”:“The power of science cannot be denied: it has given us computers and jets, vaccines and thermonuclear bombs, technologies that, for better or worse, have altered the course of history.”  End of Science, John Horgan, P.4, 1996""Computers, jets, and bombs are NOT science, but are technological inventions. We can find examples like this, where science and technology incorrectly mingle outcomes in almost every science related book, magazine, or newspaper.""Music:Alan Walker - Fade [NCS Release]https://youtu.be/bM7SZ5SBzyYMaterial for this video was prepared according to the fair use laws of the United States.

83nKXiKONiQ,The Dark side of Technology | Full Documentary,"http://www.advexon.com/Technology (from Greek τέχνη, techne, ""art, skill, cunning of hand""; and -λογία, -logia[1]) is the making, modification, usage, and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques, crafts, systems, and methods of organization, in order to solve a problem, improve a pre-existing solution to a problem, achieve a goal, handle an applied input/output relation or perform a specific function. It can also refer to the collection of such tools, including machinery, modifications, arrangements and procedures. Technologies significantly affect human as well as other animal species' ability to control and adapt to their natural environments. The term can either be applied generally or to specific areas: examples include construction technology, medical technology, and information technology.The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistorical discovery of the ability to control fire increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans in travelling in and controlling their environment. Recent technological developments, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. However, not all technology has been used for peaceful purposes; the development of weapons of ever-increasing destructive power has progressed throughout history, from clubs to nuclear weapons.Technology has affected society and its surroundings in a number of ways. In many societies, technology has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as pollution, and deplete natural resources, to the detriment of Earth's environment. Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, a term originally applied only to machines, and the challenge of traditional norms.Philosophical debates have arisen over the present and future use of technology in society, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, opining that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition. Indeed, until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but recent scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and learned to pass their knowledge to other generations.",science and technology

Engineering is the science and technology used to meet the needs and demands of society.[1] These demands include buildings, aircraft, vessels, and computer software. In order to meet society’s demands, the creation of newer technology and infrastructure must be met efficiently and cost-effectively. To accomplish this, managers and engineers have to have a mutual approach to the specified demand at hand. This can lead to shortcuts in engineering design to reduce costs of construction and fabrication. Occasionally, these shortcuts can lead to unexpected design failures.Read more : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enginee...May you find this video informative and be thrilled to subscribe for more.

Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings.The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale.Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's environment. Innovations have always influenced the values of a society and raised new questions of the ethics of technology. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics.future technology ideasfuture technology inventionsfuture technology gadgetsfuture technology predictions 2020future technology timelinefuture technology devicesfuture technology 2018future technology 2050Disclaimer- Some contents are used for educational purpose under fair use.

TY6N_iJTaIM,Falcon Heavy- Birth of a New Era in Space Exploration,"Tens of thousands of spectators made the pilgrimage from across the country & 20 million people around the world on Youtube witnessed the thunderous roar of the SpaceX's new 23-story-tall jumbo rocket as it has blasted off on its first test flight, carrying Elon Musk’s red Tesla sports car aiming for an endless trip past Mars. The Falcon Heavy rose from the same launch pad used by NASA nearly 50 years ago to send men to the Moon. With lift-off, the Heavy became the most powerful rocket in use today, doubling the lift-off punch of its closest competitor.Within three minutes, the Falcon Heavy’s two side boosters separated from the central rocket in one of the most critical points of the flight. Some eight minutes after launch, a pair of sonic booms rocked the area as the two side boosters set down in near synchrony on two landing pads.Flying atop the Falcon Heavy is SpaceX & Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s cherry-red Tesla Roadster, carrying a passenger—sort of. SpaceX revealed last weekend that a mannequin wearing the company’s new spacesuit would ride in the driver’s seat of the electric sports car.

It is home to the world's first planned cities, where every house had its own bathroom and toilet five thousand years ago. The Ancient Indians have not only given us yoga, meditation and complementary medicines, but they have furthered our knowledge of science, maths - and invented Chaturanga, which became the game of chess.According to Albert Einstein, they ""taught us how to count"", as they invented the numbers 1-9 and 'zero', without which there would be no computers or digital age. Unfairly we call this system of counting Arabic numbers - a misplaced credit.Two thousand years ago the Indians pioneered plastic surgery, reconstructing the noses and ears on the faces of people who had been disfigured through punishment or warfare. They performed eye operations such as cataract removal and invented inoculation to protect their population from Smallpox, saving thousands of lives.",science and technology

So the 2017 year for science has been very good, because all the new innovations have been discovered, 1)Firstly there is a shortage of fresh water for more than 1 billion people worldwide. Researchers from the University of California have created a solar powered device that draws water from the air at a humidity level. And while doing the test, that device pulled about three liters of water within 12-hours.2)The largest research done in July 2017, which is the Organ Bez Research. In which the DNA of the embryo in the human body can be changed. This is a gene-editing technique, through a CRISPR. This technique can be included in the major research of the human world.3)In which a new planet was researched in the science report. Whose name was given gliese 1132b. However, this Planet is 39 light years away from our planet. This is the first Planet that is bigger than the Earth and it also has Atmosphere. Due to being near Earth,4)After that, doctors in Philadelphia's Child Hospital have discovered a way to keep the fetal sheep alive from the mother's womb. The embryo calves were placed in the artificial womb, which was filled with complete amniotic fluid, because it had linked the umbilical cords to a machine due to which its blood could get oxygen.5)After that, 11 had already been discovered in the Dead Sea of ​​Jerusalem, the last cave named Crawl was discovered 60 years ago. But after so many years, in the year 2017, archaeologists at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem discovered the 12th cave near the north-west coast of the Dead Sea. Although nothing special from inside, a leather belt and some clothes. And it is considered the ancient cave of Judeo-Christian texts.6)After that another search was done in the sea. Below the Mauritius Island, the researchers discovered the fragment of an ancient continent and the lava of that continent is three billion years old. This is called ""Mauritia"". It was part of a super continent Gondwinnaland, present 200 million years ago.7)After that an undergraduate student invented fossilized teeth of small and rodent organisms while climbing rocks in Dorset, England. According to the researchers, they are the ancestors of the placental, ""animals which have given birth to them after feeding the fetus through the box,"" according to CBC they are the ancestors of mankind.8)After that, Alisha Gaurou, a student of the University of Victoria's PhD, discovered a 14,000-year-old village while digging on Trikot Island, about 500 kilometers from Victoria. The remains of this ancient village are three times as old as the pyramid of Giza. Including fish hooks, spears, coal flakes, and some old equipment to set fire.9)After that in August 2017, scientists discovered gravitational waves from binary neutron star merger. Electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves were omitted together, so scientists were able to determine that the difference between speed of light and the speed of gravity is the speed of 3 x and 7x light.10)After that, the estimated population of penguins in East Antarctica has twice the population over there. These surveys were published in March 2017. During the breeding season this survey was done on the ground and it was found that most penguins were not present on it. According to the new global estimate, there are 14 and 16 million birds, and in East Antarctica there are approximately 60 lakhs, which came to know in 2017.11)After that, a peptrocer's headpinzer was discovered in Mongolia, and their feathers were about 11 meters, that is 36 feet long, which was possibly considered one of the largest petrochemicals. In the time of the Petrosaur i.e. mesosoeq era i.e. dinosaurs used to be such birds. And the Hadpinner is some 70 million years ago.12)After this, the scientists exposed the largest volcanic field in the last summer, which is located two kilometers away from the West Antarctic ice sheet. This area comprises 91 volcanoes, one of which is at an altitude of 4,000 meters (13,000 feet). That is, due to an explosion, ice may possibly melted from below.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Music by :Fanfare for Space by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...)Source: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-...Artist: http://incompetech.com/",science and technology

V9xZFZ07UbA,The Internet Revolution and Digital Future Technology Documentary 2018,"The Internet Revolution and Digital Future Technology Documentary 2018The history of the Internet begins with the development of electronic computers in the 1950s. Initial concepts of wide area networking originated in several computer science laboratories in the United States, United Kingdom, and France.When the Internet was invented?ARPANET adopted TCP/IP on January 1, 1983, and from there researchers began to assemble the “network of networks” that became the modern Internet. The online world then took on a more recognizable form in 1990, when computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web.When did people start using the Internet?On 6 August 1991, the World Wide Web went live to the world. There was no fanfare in the global press. In fact, most people around the world didn't even know what the Internet was. Even if they did, the revolution the Web ushered in was still but a twinkle in Tim Berners-Lee's eye.When did the Internet originate?Find out here. The internet began life in 1969, when scientists working for the US Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, now known as DARPA) connected computer networks at the University of California and the Stanford Research Institute.Which country first invented the Internet?The internet protocols (TCP/IP) happened following initiatives takes by the US Government. The world-wide-web was invented by a British guy (while working at Cern) This brought us HTTP and websites. His work was inspired by the idea of hypertext. Hypertext as a concept had been bouncing around for a while.What was the original purpose of the Internet?Many people have heard that the Internet began with some military computers in the Pentagon called Arpanet in 1969. ... Bob Taylor, the Pentagon official who was in charge of the Pentagon's Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (or Arpanet) program, insists that the purpose was not military, but scientific.Please SUBSCRIBE & SHARE.https://goo.gl/sGXNEfWatch more documentaries:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...",science and technology

sX1Y2JMK6g8,SpaceX Falcon Heavy- Elon Musk's Engineering Masterpiece [Updated Version],"Tens of thousands of spectators made the pilgrimage from across the country & 22 million people around the world on Youtube witnessed the thunderous roar of the SpaceX's new 23-story-tall jumbo rocket as it has blasted off on its first test flight, carrying Elon Musk’s red Tesla sports car aiming for an endless trip past Mars. The Falcon Heavy rose from the same launch pad used by NASA nearly 50 years ago to send men to the Moon. With lift-off, the Heavy became the most powerful rocket in use today, doubling the lift-off punch of its closest competitor.Within three minutes, the Falcon Heavy’s two side boosters separated from the central rocket in one of the most critical points of the flight. Some eight minutes after launch, a pair of sonic booms rocked the area as the two side boosters set down in near synchrony on two landing pads.Flying atop the Falcon Heavy is SpaceX & Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s cherry-red Tesla Roadster, carrying a passenger—sort of. SpaceX revealed last weekend that a mannequin wearing the company’s new spacesuit would ride in the driver’s seat of the electric sports car ,nicknamed Starman.MUSIC CREDITS:-  ""Hero Memories"" by Really Slow MotionComposer: Fran SotoAlbum: SigmaYoutube link:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSgjJ...Buy Really Slow Motion musicAmazon : http://amzn.to/1lTltY5iTunes: http://bit.ly/1ee3l8KSpotify: http://bit.ly/1r3lPvNBandcamp: http://bit.ly/1DqtZSoFOOTAGE CREDITS:-00:00-00:06 00:35-00:41 01:33-01:35 The Vergechannel link:- https://www.youtube.com/user/TheVergevideo link:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7LJI...00:47-00:49 & 03:25- Anthony Garciachannel link:- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZJc...video link:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhhPs...01:19-01:20 03:13-03:15-bombcat91Channel link:- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_aW...Video link:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znVWV...01:22-01:24- videodroneChannel link:- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8Kz...video link:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNGbH...03:11- The cooper ScoopChannel link:- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOKR...Video link:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncSDV...Footage at 03:26-03:28 & voice at 03:23-03:37-Das valdez(KSpace Academy)Twitch: http://twitch.tv/dasvaldezYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJLd...Full Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw3KE...03:28-03:30- Physics AnonymousChannel link:- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzu3...Video link:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tikak...03:32-Emmerich Video ProductionsChannel Link:- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLkP...Video link:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMCC0...Elon Musk's Statement courtesy:- 00:20-00:34- The Verge00:46-00:54- CNNMoney#ElonMusk #SpaceX #FalconHeavy",science and technology

iKEuUcLRh2I,The Future Of Transportation - Incredible Technology To Come,"You will see what is the future of transportation.Actually,our cities have a lot of problems.Smogs,pollutions and traffic jams are some of these issues. They prevent a good quality of life in big cities. However there are some proposals to fix these problems. These technologies are the future of transportation.These technologies will change the world forever1-The Mercedes-Benz Future BusWhat urban public transport will look like in the future is shown by the semi-automated city bus with CityPilot – it operates even more safely, efficiently and comfortably than conventional buses. Connectivity plus camera and radar systems with data fusion are catapulting the city bus into the future. Mercedes-Benz is showing this spectacular technology on an equally spectacular technology platform, the Mercedes-Benz Future Bus with CityPilot.The CityPilot is able to recognise traffic lights, communicate with them and safely negotiate junctions controlled by them. It can also recognise obstacles, especially pedestrians on the road, and brake autonomously. It approaches bus stops automatically, where it opens and closes its doors. And not least, it is able to drive through tunnels. The bus will be environment friendly too.2-Transit Elevated Bus :The Transit Elevated Bus (TEB) is a proposed new bus concept where a guided bus straddles above road traffic, giving it the alternative names such as straddling bus, straddle bus, land airbus, or tunnel bus by international media.3- Automated and self-driving carsThese cars will be incredible. No need to drive them because they are self-driving and automated.They will be smart,environmment friendly,more luxurious ,prettier and safer for everyone.4- Elon Musk underground tunnel systemsThis is firstly proposed to reduce traffic jams in Los Angeles.An incredible underground system of tunnels will connect the city.The vehicles will ride on a big skate that will go at 200 km per hour.This is a good solution to reduce traffic.5 -Hyperloop Another incredible vision of Elon Musk. The system will operate like Maglev do,but inside big tube. These tube will have low air pressure.Due to this low pression,objects will go faster because no force will stop the speed of the object. Capsule travelling inside these tube ,could reach a speed of 1200 km per hour. In the future it could be 5000. Several Hyperloop are proposed around the world. The goal is to cut travel time and protect the planet.6-Falcon Big Rocket by Elon MuskThese rocket are used in the rocket tested by SpaceX.But instead to go to mars or space,they will be used to travel to a city to another. It will be the fastest travel system ever conceived.The rocket will reach a speed of 5000 km/h. You can go to Paris to Sydney in less than 1 hour. Hong Kong to New Delhi in less than 30 minutes or New York to Los Angeles in 30 minutes too. You will reach any cities around the world in less than 1 hour.7-Airbus Plane for 2050It's just beautiful. None of the plane that fly actually ,can compete with it. No words to describe how beautiful it will be.8- Aether Cruise:It  will be the future private jet of rich.Based on an airship platform, the “Aether” cruise experience by UK-based designer Mac Byers allows guests to experience a wider range of destinations in a shorter time, all the while enjoying some of the greatest views imaginable.9- Flying Cars This is the biggest revolution to come. Imagine to have your personal flying car one day. It has been a long time since we wanted them and finally they are coming. Pal-V is the first car available for purchase. Aeromobil 3.0 will come in 2020 and prices start at 1.5 million$. The Terrafugia TF-X will be available in 2020.Ehang 184 will be the first automated flying car and the sales will start in 2020.This is the most interesting moment since the industrial revolutions in past centuries. Technologies are changing our lives,but this time for the better. This time was awaited since many decades.Please enjoy the video and share it !Tell me what you think of the video .Thank you for watching the video and subscribe !We do NOT own the video materials and all credits belong to respectful owners.

rNV-yKJWQC8,SpaceX- Rewind 2018: A Year To Remember,"SpaceX Rewind 2018:-Building off its earlier momentum—8 launches in 2016 and 18 in 2017, SpaceX pulled off 21 launches in 2018, a staggering achievement for the 16-year-old company. SpaceX’s reusable rocket technology moved out of the proof-of-concept stage to become the backbone of a growing fleet of flight-proven rockets. Although the company landed its first rocket in 2015, it took until 2017 for SpaceX to reuse its first booster. This year landings became almost routine, and engineers bid farewell to the moderately reusable Falcons of yesterday, ushering in an era of more capable Falcons, dubbed the Block 5.Another long-standing goal was to debut its heavy-lift rocket, the Falcon Heavy. First estimated to fly back in 2013, the Falcon Heavy took its inaugural flight on Feb. 6th. After sending a cherry red Tesla roadster (complete with Starman pilot) on a journey past Mars, the three cores of the Falcon Heavy—each essentially its own Falcon 9 rocket—returned to Earth. Two of the boosters touched down in perfect synchronization on LZ-1 and LZ-2, SpaceX’s designated landing zones at Cape Canaveral. The Heavy’s center booster, however, missed its targeted landing spot on a waiting drone ship, and plopped into the Atlantic Ocean.Musk announced that Yusaku Maezawa was the mysterious billionaire who had reserved both seats the first paying customer on SpaceX’s next-generation rocket—the BFR. Billed from the start as an interplanetary transport vehicle, BFR (which is composed of two parts, a rocket and a spaceship capable of carrying hundreds of people into space)THUMBNAIL CREDITS:-  Joe Burbank, MBOMusic credits :-'Voyager by Jo BlankenburgYoutube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV6Yy...#ElonMusk #SpaceXRewind2018",science and technology

0na3d_5PNW0,HUMAN BODY FACTS || हमारे शरीर के रोमांचक रहस्य || HUMAN BODY INFO || HUMAN BODY AMAZING FACTS,"HELLO  GUYS  HOW  R  U  ALL  . IN  THIS  VIDEO  IM  TALK  ABOUT  15  AMAZING  FACTS  ABOUT  HUMAN  BODY  . The human body is the entire structure of a human being. It is composed of many different types of cells that together create tissues and subsequently organ systems. They ensure homeostasis and the viability of the human body.It comprises a head, neck, trunk (which includes the thorax and abdomen), arms and hands, legs and feet.The study of the human body involves anatomy, physiology, histology and embryology. The body varies anatomically in known ways. Physiology focuses on the systems and organs of the human body and their functions. Many systems and mechanisms interact in order to maintain homeostasis, with safe levels of substances such as sugar and oxygen in the blood.The body is studied by health professionals, physiologists, anatomists, and by artists to assist them in their work.The human body is composed of elements including hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, calcium and phosphorus.[1] These elements reside in trillions of cells and non-cellular components of the body.The adult male body is about 60% water for a total water content of some 42 litres. This is made up of about 19 litres of extracellular fluid including about 3.2 litres of blood plasma and about 8.4 litres of interstitial fluid, and about 23 litres of fluid inside cells.[2] The content, acidity and composition of the water inside and outside cells is carefully maintained. The main electrolytes in body water outside cells are sodium and chloride, whereas within cells it is potassium and other phosphates.DONT  FORGET  HIT  :L-I-K-E-S-H-A-R-ES-U-B-S-C-R-I-B-E AFFILIATE  LINKS :MY  SET  UP :MY  PHONE : http://amzn.to/2n85SZRMY  COMPUTER : http://amzn.to/2Gcqg4IFOR  YOUTUBERS :BEST  MIC  FOR  YOUTUBERS : http://amzn.to/2E3psybBEST CAMERA FOR YOUTUBERS : http://amzn.to/2n7AF8KBEST LAPTOP FOR YOUTUBERS : http://amzn.to/2n3F78ESOCIAL  LINKS  :FACEBOOK : https://www.facebook.com/GuriKhindaOf...INSTAGRAM : https://www.instagram.com/guri_khinda...CONTACT  FOR  SPONSORSHIP : TARSEM9464@GMAIL.COMYOU  SHOULD  WATCH  THIS  :11 .

RpSbgczuqdw,Falcon Heavy Montage [Extended version]- A Momentous Technological Feat,"Tens of thousands of spectators made the pilgrimage from across the country & 22 million people around the world on Youtube witnessed the thunderous roar of the SpaceX's new 23-story-tall jumbo rocket as it has blasted off on its first test flight, carrying Elon Musk’s red Tesla sports car aiming for an endless trip past Mars. The Falcon Heavy rose from the same launch pad used by NASA nearly 50 years ago to send men to the Moon. With lift-off, the Heavy became the most powerful rocket in use today, doubling the lift-off punch of its closest competitor. Within three minutes, the Falcon Heavy’s two side boosters separated from the central rocket in one of the most critical points of the flight. Some eight minutes after launch, a pair of sonic booms rocked the area as the two side boosters set down in near synchrony on two landing pads. Flying atop the Falcon Heavy is SpaceX & Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s cherry-red Tesla Roadster, carrying a passenger—sort of. SpaceX revealed last weekend that a mannequin wearing the company’s new spacesuit would ride in the driver’s seat of the electric sports car ,nicknamed Starman.MUSIC CREDITS:- ""Hero Memories"" by Really Slow Motion Composer: Fran SotoAlbum: SigmaYoutube link:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSgjJ...

Inventions like the VCR that were once high tech -- and now aren't -- proved challenging for some: The VCR became obsolete before many of us learned how to program one. And who knew that working with atoms and molecules would become the future of technology? The futurists, of course.Forecasting the future of technology is for dreamers who hope to innovate better tools -- and for the mainstream people who hope to benefit from the new and improved. Many inventions are born in the lab and never make it into the consumer market, while others evolve beyond the pace of putting good regulations on their use.Next, we'll take a look at some sound-loving atoms, tiny tools for molecules, huge bunches of data and some disgruntled bands of people who may want to set all of this innovation back with the stroke of a keyboard.NASA has challenged designers to develop a conventional drone to work inside a space station, navigating with no ‘up’ or ‘down’. The winning design, ArachnoBeeA, would use cameras and tiny beacons to manoeuvre its way around. How popular drones would be in such a confined space is a different question.Hate commuting? Imagine, instead, your train carriage hurtling down a tunnel at the same speed as a commercial jet airliner. That’s the dream of PayPal, Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk. His Hyperloop system would see ‘train’ passengers travel at up to 760mph through a vacuum tube, propelled by compressed air and induction motors. A site has been chosen with the goal of starting test runs in two years. Once built, the loop will ferry passengers between San Francisco and LA in 35 minutes, compared to 7.5 hours by train.Edited & Voice by:Vikas sharma (http://www.facebook.com/hsvikas)Written by:Vikas sharma (https://www.facebook.com/hsvikas)Please Subscribe Mysterious Dunia:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcjk...Like Mysterious Dunia on Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/mysteriousyo...check out my all videos:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcjk...Things i use: Video Editor - Sony Vegas Pro 14 software for audio recording- AudacityPowered by:Mysterious Dunia ProductionHelp us in growing my channel Please Like,Comment,Subscribe n ShareThank You",science and technology

It does not refer to the lack of weight under gravity experienced in free fall or orbit, or to balancing the force of gravity with some other force, such as electromagnetism or aerodynamic lift. Anti-gravity is a recurring concept in science fiction, particularly in the context of spacecraft propulsion. Examples are the gravity blocking substance ""Cavorite"" in H. G. Wells' The First Men in the Moon and the Spindizzy machines in James Blish's Cities in Flight. In Newton's law of universal gravitation, gravity was an external force transmitted by unknown means. In the 20th century, Newton's model was replaced by general relativity where gravity is not a force but the result of the geometry of spacetime. Under general relativity, anti-gravity is impossible except under contrived circumstances. Quantum physicists have postulated the existence of gravitons, massless elementary particles that transmit gravitational force, but the possibility of creating or destroying these is unclear. ""Anti-gravity"" is often used colloquially to refer to devices that look as if they reverse gravity even though they operate through other means, such as lifters, which fly in the air by moving air with electromagnetic fields.",science and technology

At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",science and technology

jha56v5zRLg,2050 INVENTIONS FUTURE || FUTURE INVENTIONS IN HINDI || FUTURE TECHNOLOGY 2050 || TECH PRO,"HELLO  GUYS  HOW  R  U  ALL  , IN  THIS  VIDEO  IM  TALK  ABOUT  4  FUTURE  INVENTIONS  IN  2050 .An invention is a unique or novel device, method, composition or process. The invention process is a process within an overall engineering and product development process. It may be an improvement upon a machine or product or a new process for creating an object or a result. An invention that achieves a completely unique function or result may be a radical breakthrough. Such works are novel and not obvious to others skilled in the same field. An inventor may be taking a big step in success or failure.Some inventions can be patented. A patent legally protects the intellectual property rights of the inventor and legally recognizes that a claimed invention is actually an invention. The rules and requirements for patenting an invention vary from country to country and the process of obtaining a patent is often expensive.Another meaning of invention is cultural invention, which is an innovative set of useful social behaviours adopted by people and passed on to others.[1] The Institute for Social Inventions collected many such ideas in magazines and books.[2] Invention is also an important component of artistic and design creativity. Inventions often extend the boundaries of human knowledge, experience or capability.Inventions are of three kinds: scientific-technological (including medicine), sociopolitical (including economics and law), and humanistic, or cultural.Scientific-technological inventions include railroads, aviation, vaccination, hybridization, antibiotics, astronautics, holography,the atomic bomb, computing, the Internet, and the smartphone.Sociopolitical inventions comprise new laws, institutions, and procedures that change modes of social behavior and establish new forms of human interaction and organization. Examples include the British Parliament, the US Constitution, the Manchester (UK) General Union of Trades, the Boy Scouts, the Red Cross, the Olympic Games, the United Nations, the European Union, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as movements such as socialism, Zionism, suffragism,feminism, and animal-rights veganism.DONT   FORGET  HIT  : L-I-K-ES-H-A-R-ES-U-B-S-C-R-I-B-EAFFILIATE  LINKS :MY  SET  UP :MY  PHONE : http://amzn.to/2n85SZRMY  COMPUTER : http://amzn.to/2Gcqg4IFOR  YOUTUBERS :BEST  MIC  FOR  YOUTUBERS : http://amzn.to/2E3psybBEST CAMERA FOR YOUTUBERS : http://amzn.to/2n7AF8KBEST LAPTOP FOR YOUTUBERS : http://amzn.to/2n3F78ESOCIAL  LINKS  :FACEBOOK : https://www.facebook.com/GuriKhindaOf...INSTAGRAM : https://www.instagram.com/guri_khinda...CONTACT  FOR  SPONSORSHIP : TARSEM9464@GMAIL.COMYOU  SHOULD  WATCH  THIS  : 11 .

In today’s food and travel video, we’re in Old Dhaka trying some AMAZING Bangladeshi street food that is MIND BLOWING and tasty!!!When we first flew in to Dhaka, Bangladesh, we had no idea how AMAZING Bengali cuisine is. After trying the street food in Old Dhaka, I’m convinced that it’s some of the best street food around the world, and that Street food in Bangladesh is worth spending a lifetime exploring! First up, we’re going to the Dhaka University area to try a famous street food in Dhaka, the Kola Bhorta, an ULTRA complex and delicious street food made in a mortar and pestle. It had hog plum, mustard, olive, tamarind, sugar, chili, coriander, and chili, and was made by the most friendly vendor! It was spicy, sour, bitter, sweet, pungent, and very intense!Next, we’re bringing you to the New Market area of Dhaka, right outside Old Dhaka, an area bustling with food stalls and super fast paced bustle. The street food vendors here work with ULTRA FAST speed and you can tell that everyone is in a hurry because there is so much food and street stalls packed in here. I ordered a Bhel Puri, a kind of crispy puff filled with chickpea and lentil mash and chili with tamarind chutney and topped with a cold cucumber, tomato, and onion salad. It was an amazing street food to try! Next up, we’re bringing you to a FAMOUS Restaurant in Dhaka, the MAMA Haleem! Here, an ULTRA THICK beef stew is prepared with lentils, wheat, mustard, and Bengali spices in a HUGE POT!

Here, one of the most delicious mutton food stews AKA pays is served bright an early every day at 6am. We got up early and were surprised to see the place was PACKED with locals slurping away at this delicious Bengali food! We also ordered a beef heart curry, dal, local tea, and naan. It was an incredibly filling and flavour packed breakfast!And before visiting the BRAIN FRY KING of Bangladesh, we’re going for a FAMOUS biryani dish in Old Dhaka, the Kachi biryani. It was prepared in these huge pots with big goat leg pieces and was one of the most aromatic biryani’s I’ve ever tried! It had a caraway flavour and was a little mustardy as well! Mustard is such an important part of Bengali cuisine, and we fell in love with the food during our trip mainly because of this mustard flavour in everything, it’s so delicious and fluffy!!After the AMAZING Biryani, we’re bringing you to our final stop, the BRAIN FRY KING of Bangladesh! Here, you can taste amazing Brain fry and beef chap marinated in a ton of spices and put into a deep and dark oil that is intensely flavourful. When it comes out, you grab a luchi and wrap it up and pop it in your mouth, and it’s quite delicious!

If you just walk in you can get 400 or 600 gram shrimp probably, but the 800 gram single shrimp are hard to come by these days in Thailand.Kui Mong (กุ่ยหมง) is very well known among Thais, mainly because most restaurant grill their river shrimp, but Kui Mong (กุ่ยหมง) is the first to deep fry them, and serve them in a ridiculously delicious oily shrimp sauce. The sauce is one of the greatest things you’ll ever taste on rice, combined with more chili garlic sauce and an alternating bite of succulent river shrimp.They owners family are very nice, but unfortunately since it’s such a secret recipe, we weren’t able to see the cooking - so that’s why this is just a short extra Thai food video - only showing the massive deep fried Thai river shrimp and eating them.Price - 2,000 THB ($63.44), per 800 grams shrimpKui Mong (กุ่ยหมง)Address: Khok Khram, Bang Pla Ma District, Suphan Buri 72150, Thailand (Google map: https://goo.gl/maps/1hmdXEXFddr)People featured in this video:David (The Hungry Tourist): https://www.instagram.com/the.hungry....Puppup: https://www.instagram.com/puppup_food...Abram: https://www.instagram.com/ramen_beast/Sinan: https://www.instagram.com/tatdedektifi/Thank you for watching this video.

She loves to eat, and she’s just an awesome person!Quezon City is a city next to Manila, and it’s actually a bigger city than Manila, but it’s part of Manila. So for this Filipino street food tour, I met up with my great friend Reby, who is from Quezon City, and we hit the streets to find some incredibly delicious food. Here’s everywhere we went and the dishes that we ate.University of the Philippines Diliman - The University of the Philippines is known throughout Manila for its street food stalls, mainly because lots of students gather on campus to enjoy delicious food and hang out.Rodic’s Diner - Tapsilog - 95 PHP ($1.91) - We began at Rodic’s Diner a legendary diner at University of Philippines and tried their legendary tapsilog. This is a well known Filipino food dish that includes cured carabao (water buffalo) meat, topped over rice, with a fried egg on top as well. It makes a great breakfast dish, and it was a great way to start the day off with. Outside of the student center, you’ll find some other Filipino street food carts selling snacks like cheese ice cream (20 PHP ($0.40) and cheese corn (20 PHP ($0.40).Mang Larry's Isawan (Isaw - 60 PHP ($1.21) total) - Probaby the most famous street food at University of Philippines in Quezon City is Mang Larry's Isawan, a stall that serves grilled skewers of mostly pig and chicken intestines. The intestines and nice and clean, and grilled over hot fire, before you get them. When you get your skewers, you dip them in vinegar, or more like drown them in vinegar, and eat. They were truly incredible, like little bites of hollow crunchy sausage.Lagro Market - Continuing our Filipino street food tour of Quezon City, Reby brought us to a local market called Lagro Market. As soon as we arrived I noticed one of the coolest rotisserie chicken street food carts that I’ve ever seen, and we had to make a stop and try some of their chicken (lechon manok (roast chicken). The chicken was alright, a little dry, but tasty, and the setting and atmosphere, plus the chicken street food cart, was very cool. Half chicken - 85 PHP ($1.71).Buko (30 PHP ($0.60) - Buko is the word for young coconut, and there’s nothing more refreshing than a young coconut on the streets of Manila.Mango shrimp paste (7 PHP ($0.14) per piece) - Although this is a humble easy Filipino street food snack, it’s one of my favorites. A sour green mango is cut, then topped with spicy shrimp paste and you eat it like a caramel apple. Marawi, Mindanao, Philippines Food - We ended this Filipino food tour by going to a random street food stall that we came across, located across the street from the market. The little stall was serving a type of cuisine from Marawi, located on the Southern Philippines island of Mindanao. It was also Halal food, and they had a variety of typical Filipino food dishes like adobo, but also some Filipino dishes I had never tried before due to the regional differences.

TSENA’NY TANTSAHA TALATAMATY: Rice Porridge + Chinese Noodle SoupADDRESS: Talatamaty City  OPEN: 3AM - 7AM (or whenever the police shut it down) Four miles outside of Madagascar’s capital city, Antananarivo, lies Talatamaty City. Talatamaty City is home to one of the country’s largest local morning markets, Tsena’ny Tantsaha. Sellers open up shop at 3am, selling everything from produce to fabrics. And lucky for us, the market has no shortage of food to try as well. 🥣RICE PORRIDGE: Zebu (Malagasy cattle) and sausage are mixed with leaves, ginger, special Malagasy rice, porridge and spices. 🥡CHINESE NOODLE DISH: Pasta, macaroni, potato, mayonnaise and zebu skin. ----2. TALATA VOLON’ONDRY: Sausage + KobaADDRESS: Talata Volon’ondry OPEN: Varies Talata Volon’ondry is a village located just outside of Antananarivo. The village is known for producing sausage and Madagascar’s national snack, koba. 🥔SAUSAGE: There are typically two types of sausage being sold - zebu sausage and a halal style potato sausage. This snack is frequently accompanied by local rum. 🇲🇬KOBA: Lay out banana leaf spines with banana leaves on top. Add a layer of rice flour to prevent the koba mixture from sticking to the banana leaves. Then add the koba mixture, a combination of crushed raw peanuts and sugar. Wrap it all up in the banana leaves and allow it to cook in a bit of water for 3 days. Koba is beloved across Madagascar, primarily sold on the street or to people in their cars as they drive through a city. The fuel from the ingredients gives people energy and helps them stay full even when walking long distances without and source of food along the way.💸PRICE: Sausage .14 USD/500 MGA | Koba .50 USD/1,756 MGA- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -💬COME SAY HI:INSTAGRAM » http://bit.ly/BestEverInstagram (@besteverfoodreviewshow)FACEBOOK » http://bit.ly/BEFRSFacebook💗SUPPORT OUR MISSION:Patreon is a platform that allows people to support creators on a recurring basis.

yWhU40m-6uU,15 Times Gordon Ramsay Actually LIKED THE FOOD!,"We all know Gordon Ramsay is famous for screaming insults and spitting out food, but there are times where Gordon Ramsay is actually nice and is impressed by the food! We put together a list of 15 times when Gordon Ramsay actually liked the food! Like we’ve seen in our two previous videos, it does happen. It’s just pretty rare. That's why we continued to search high and low so we could show more of those happier times in Gordon’s life.  Most chefs are incapable of satisfying Gordon Ramsay’s sophisticated needs, but every now and then a chef manages to blow Ramsay away. It doesn’t happen often, but we’ve found the rare instances where Gordon Ramsay actually enjoyed the food. Just like we’ve seen in our past videos, Gordon Ramsay has had a few moments where he actually liked the food that other people have prepared for him. We’ve done some additional research and found 15 more Times Gordon Ramsay Actually LIKED THE FOOD from other people on shows such as MasterChef, MasterChef Junior, and The F Word.As you have seen in our other videos. Gordon Ramsay liking food is not a hoax. This actually happened. So, hold onto your forks & knives, because you are about to be blown away for the 3rd time!If you think  you would like the food Gordon Ramsay ate in this video, then comment #RamsayLikedTimeline:0:23 Perfect Sausage Rolls1:27 The Miraculous Vegan Burger2:11 Impressing Gordon on Live TV3:04 Just Some Good Fries3:43 A cheap dessert4:31 Bananas Foster from a Flamboyant Chef5:30 A Kid Chef With A Phenomenal Dish6:14 An Impressive Salmon7:09 An “OMFG” dessert7:59 Beef Wellington8:49 Beef Wellington, Second Round9:40 A Show-Stopping Filet Mignon10:21 Alexander’s Dessert11:05 Tasty Sardines11:56 The Perfectly Replicated SashimiStill haven’t subscribed to Babble Top on YouTube? ►► https://goo.gl/Grh1Wg10 Times Gordon Ramsay Actually LIKED THE FOOD!

UvDGBIkJaqQ,"Chinese Street Food DAN DAN NOODLE Tour in Sichuan, China | INSANELY GOOD and SPICY Szechuan Noodles","One of the best Chinese street foods you will ever eat in China is the Dan Dan Noodles!  Spicy Chinese Dan Dan noodles are the best street food in China! If you love spicy Sichuan food and street food in China, then you're going to love Dan Dan noodles, because they are so flavorful and covered in a rich chili oil!In this Chinese street food video, we're bringing you on a full on Dan Dan noodle tour of Chengdu, China, DEEP in the heart of Sichuan in Southwest China. This is the land of delicious and spicy Sichuan cuisine, sometimes spelled Szechuan cuisine. There are so many famous Sichuan foods to try here in Chengdu, but today, we are trying 4 different variations of Dan Dan noodles, also sometimes called Zajiang noodles.

In my opinion, the best noodle dish in China is dan dan noodles, right here in Chengdu, Sichuan. China has some of the best street food around the world, and these dan dan noodles were INSANELY GOOD, some of the best noodles in China for sure!If you're traveling to China to eat and try different street foods, and perhaps want to learn a little bit about Chinese food and chinese cooking in the process, you need to try a few different variations of Dan Dan noodles. When they prepare the traditional Chinese dan dan noodle recipe right on the street, you can watch as they scoop the main ingredients like chili oil, soy sauce, sichuan peppercorn, and garlic right into the noodle bowl and then place the steaming hot noodles right over top. It's truly satisfying! After they put the noodles over top, they place their signature fried ground pork on top, known in Chinese as shaozi. When your dan dan noodles arrive to your table, it is very important to mix up all the chili oil and all of the ingredients throughout. This ensures that the flavour and the hot oil gets coated onto each noodle before you take a bite. It's also quite satisfying mixing the noodles and watching the dark red oil slowly turn each noodle from white into red and silky smooth. When you take your first bite, you'll understand why this is one of the BEST Chinese street foods you need to try. The spicy noodles are coated with an incredibly aromatic chili oil and really send you straight up to heaven! It's one of the best forms of Chinese cooking!

It was an amazing day, and I have so much love to Malaysia as it was one of the first countries where I started making street food videos - as you’ll see in the video!Ok, here are all the street food stalls and restaurants we ate at on this tour:Mansion Tea StallThe thing to order here is the roti canai special, roti that chopped up, then doused in a variety of curry sauces, sambal, and a few soft boiled eggs. It’s a perfect way to begin your day in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 2.80 RM ($0.68) per plateNasi Lemak TanglinNasi lemak is often considered the national food of Malaysia, and there are plenty of places to eat it throughout Kuala Lumpur. Having been around since 1948, Nasi Lemak Tanglin is a place I had wanted to go for a while. It was overall very good, with a nice laid back atmosphere and surrounded by nature. Nasi lemak - about 8 RM ($1.94) per plateIkan Bakar Seri Melaka (Jalan Bellamy)One of my favorite places to eat ikan bakar, grilled fish, is on Jalan Bellamy. Back in 2012, I had to hike over a highway and climb a few fences to get there as I was only on foot. In this video, I’m a bit older, and we had a car! The ikan bakar was just as good as I remember it. Total price - 68 RM ($16.51) for everythingSri Ganapathi MessOne of the best things about Malaysian food is its incredible diversity, including Malay, Chinese, and Indian food. Banana leaf south Indian food is very popular and I was recommended to try Sri Ganapathi Mess, a restaurant tucked away into a home. An amazing south Indian food experience in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 59 RM ($14.32) for 4 peopleKedai Kopi Lai FoongFinally, another dish that many had recommended me was the unique clam noodles in Kuala Lumpur Chinatown at the legendary Kedai Kopi Lai Foong.

Go eat at Rahsia Kitchen when you’re in Kuala Terengganu!Subscribe http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe for 2 new videos every weekT-shirts and caps: https://goo.gl/6WdK1lTERENGGANU, MALAYSIA - I was really excited to visit the East Coast of main peninsular Malaysia, known especially for Malay food. From the moment I arrived and started eating fermented durian, fermented fish sauce, and tons of different curries, I knew it was amazing place.We met up with Pet, head chef of Rahsia Kitchen - by the way they serve excellent Western food in Kuala Terengganu - and he took us around for the day to eat some of the best local Malay food in Terengganu.Nasi Dagang Atas Tol - When Malaysian think of Malay food in Terengganu, the number one dish they would think of, that’s associated with the state is nasi dagang. Nasi dagang is rice cooked with coconut milk and fenugreek, then served with a tuna curry. It’s an amazing dish and something you don’t want to miss. Nasi Dagang Atas Tol is also known for their bubble bath milk tea, which has suds like I’ve never seen.Price - about 3.50 MYR ($0.96) per plateLocal market and Genius Malay food - At the market we met up with Naqwit Mohammed who is a local artist and musician. He connected with Pett and I on social media, and met up with us to show us around the market since he’s from that village. The market was incredible, packed full of delicious Malaysian food, and with an incredibly friendly feel. The namu namu fruit was unique and delicious, and a first for me, and I also was fascinated by the fish mixed with coconut, then re-filled back into fish shape - this was a genius food for me. Perfect place to walk around and sample Malay foods.Singgang Budu Restaurant - For lunch we drove into Kuala Terengganu, the main city and had lunch at Singgang Budu Restaurant, know for nasi campur (mix of different dishes), eaten along with budu sauce (fermented anchovy sauce) and tempoyak (fermented durian). Great meal.Warung Pok Nong - Finally, another unique and very locally popular restaurant in Terengganu is Warung Pok Nong, known for their extreme deep fried seafood, and located along the ocean. It’s an amazing place, where you can snack on some incredibly crunchy seafood.It was amazing day of food and fun in Terengganu.

After being dissatisfied with the falafel and shawarma offerings in New York, Freddy took matters into his own hands by starting King of Falafel & Shawarma in 2002. Since then, his enterprise has grown, with a truck in Astoria, a cart in Midtown, and a newly opened restaurant in Queens. They also serve chicken over rice, kebabs, meatballs, and other Palestinian specialties.

We found some of the BEST Bangladeshi Street food in  Old Dhaka! Join us as we take you for the ULTIMATE Bengali street food adventure through the DEEP back alleys of Old Dhaka! Today I'm (Trevor James, The Food Ranger), bringing you for some of the BEST Street Food in Bangladesh!Make sure to follow The Food Ranger behind the scenes here:►https://www.instagram.com/thefoodranger►Make sure to Subscribe to The Food Ranger here: http://bit.ly/2cCy2ubBangladesh is a true street food heaven. We didn't know when we flew in, but there is a LOT of delicious street food to eat in Bangladesh. In Old Dhaka, AKA Puran Dhaka, you can  spend a lifetime trying new street foods around every corner. And what I loved so much from eating street food around Old Dhaka was not only the delicious mustardy flavour of the street food here, but the friendliness of the Bangladeshi people. Everywhere we went to eat street food in Bangladesh, the peoople welcomed us with open hearts and a big smile. It left a huge impression on us and left us inspired to come back to eat more street food in Bangladesh again. The Bengali food you will taste when you travel in Bangladesh is incredibly delicious. After tasting my first bharta in Old Dhaka, I was convinced that this is some of the best street food around the world. There truly is no other flavour like the food in Bangladesh! You have to come here to try it yourself!To start out our HUGE Bangladesh Street Food Tour, we visited Puran dhaka AKA Old dhaka bright and early to eat some famous Dhakan Bhakor Khani, also known as the Dhakan biscuit. It's a wheat dough and semolina flour biscuit that has 2 versions, one sweet and one plain. The sweet version has dough and semolina soaked in molasses and saffron. The dough is pushed DEEP inside the tandoor oven, the same ovens used to cook famous Bangladeshi recipes all over the country. It goes PERFECTLY with some delicious Bangladeshi street chai! There are many Bakorkhani stalls in Puran Daka (Old Dhaka), but we visited the most famous one, Nashu Faruker Shera Bakorkhani.After that amazing Bangladeshi street food biscuit, we went for the ULTIMATE meal of Bangladeshi cuisine, the bhorta feast! We're taking you to Nirob Hotel for some AMAZING Bhortas! When you first come to Bangladesh, everyone tells you to eat the Bhortas, and you may not be sure what they are. Bhortas are a special Bengali cuisine usually made of mashed fish or mashed vegetables with mustard oil, chili, garlic, onion, and the occasional sprinkle of lime. The bhortas are all brought to your table and you pay for what you eat, and leave what you don't touch. I ate a SPICY duck curry that was out of this world! After the amazing Bengali curry heaven, we made our way to the most FAMOUS street food in Old Dhaka, the haji biryani. Highly seasoned rice is cooked in mustard oil and filled with extremely tender goat meat and topped with lime! SUPER TASTY!After this, we're bringing you to a solid street dessert in Old Dhaka, Bangladesh, the lassi and faluda, found at beauty lassi, one of the tastiest lassis in the whole country! I personally loved the faluda and found it to be one of my favourite desserts I've ever had!After the lassi, we're taking you to try a famous Bangladeshi street food, the Pitha rice flour pancake loaded with spicy mustard bhorta. You can find these all over the streets of Old Dhaka and you should definitely try one!After this, we're finishing off the night by going for the famous Murgh pulao found at nanna biryani. The best part of this dish was the sweet and rich onion gravy that covered the super tender chicken and pulao rice!If you're thinking of traveling to Bangladesh to eat street food in Bangladesh, DO IT! The food is amazing, the people are friendly, and you will have a great time! I know we will be back for sure!► BRAND NEW Chili Oil 4 Life Merch here:  https://www.thefoodranger.com/Chilioi...The Food Ranger YouTube: ► www.youtube.com/thefoodrangerThe Food Ranger Instagram:► www.instagram.com/thefoodrangerThe Food Ranger FB:► www.facebook.com/thefoodranger► MUSIC I USE (Great For YouTubers): http://bit.ly/FoodRangerMusic►BEST VPN FOR CHINA (ACCESS YOUTUBE): http://bit.ly/AccessYouTubeinChina► MERCH AVAILABLE HERE: https://shop.bonfire.com/thefoodranger/We're going for more street food around the world!",food

It was a thrilling night, so much Thai food, and so much fun.Later in the night we also met up with Chef Ton from Le Du: https://www.instagram.com/cheftonn/ when we ate the extreme Mama instant noodles at Jay Oh.Here are all the restaurants we ate at:Sawang (ร้านสว่างบะหมี่ ก้ามปู) - To begin the night, we ate at Sawang (ร้านสว่างบะหมี่ ก้ามปู), a legendary restaurant in Bangkok for egg noodles and crab. You can also order their pork noodles which are delicious. I ordered ba mee kam boo, egg noodles with crab claw and the biggest size of the claw. A bit expensive, but so good - 400 THB Google map: https://goo.gl/maps/fwjy5cJyo8S2Lim Lao Ngow Fish Ball Noodle (ลิ้มเหล่าโหงว (สาขาเยาวราช) - Known for their fresh fish balls Lim Lao Ngow Fish Ball Noodle (ลิ้มเหล่าโหงว (สาขาเยาวราช) is a street food stall in Bangkok’s Chinatown. Their fishballs are delicious and bouncy.

It’s incredibly taste especially with seafood sauce.

Z-tCeaeLm3E,"Most INSANE LAMB PIT BARBACOA - Mexican Food in Texcoco + AZTEC Pyramids, Mexico!","►SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe►T-shirts available now: https://migrationology.com/store/From Oaxaca, we flew to Mexico City, and to begin our Mexico City food tour!We landed at Benito Juárez International Airport and I had arranged for a driver to meet us at the airport to take us first to eat barbacoa - one of the ultimate of all Mexican meat dishes, and then on to go to the Aztec Pyramids of Teotihuacan.We drove straight to a small town in the mountains called Texcoco. The hills around Texcoco are known for their barbacoa, Mexican style of barbecue. Even when I was in the US, I remember seeing little hole in the wall restaurant serving “Barbacoa estilo Texcoco,” Texcoco style Mexican barbacoa - so it’s famous for this dish.El Pica I - The restaurant I wanted to try was El Pica I, and even in this small mountain town, the restaurant was absolutely bumping - there was a meat party happening. You could smell the aroma of the lamb as we drove in. You choose a table, and you walk around and self serve your food. There are many Mexican foods to eat, but the real reason you come here is for the lamb barbacoa - the most insane lamb pit bbq! The meat is cooked in underground clay ovens, and when they open an oven it looks like they are opening a mine.The lamb barbacoa was some of the most tender meat I’ve ever experienced. It was fatty and juicy and ultra flavorful.Price - 800 MXN ($42.95) for 2 kg.Teotihuacan - Stuffed full of lamb, we continued on to Teotihuacan, the ancient Aztec city, known for its giant pyramids. Unfortunately since we went on a Sunday, it was absolutely packed, so busy that we couldn’t even hike to the top of the Pyramid of the Sun because we ran out of time. But nevertheless, it was still worth visiting and it’s very impressive to see.Entrance price - 70 MXN ($3.76)Highlight of today for me was the insanely irresistible lamb barbacoa in Texcoco, WOW.

Among their delicacies is monkfish, a very rare fish that is hard to find in Tokyo, even in big fish markets. Monkfish liver (ankimo) is typically considered the tastiest part of the fish and was even listed on CNN’s 2011 list of the World’s 50 Most Delicious Foods. We were fortunate enough to get a taste of this dish, which is not a typical menu item at Takamaru Fresh Fish Store. Monkfish hotpot is a bit more common than monkfish liver, frequently eaten during the winter months in Japan. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -💬COME SAY HI:INSTAGRAM » http://bit.ly/InstaSonnySideFACEBOOK » http://bit.ly/BEFRSFacebook💗SUPPORT OUR MISSION: Patreon is a platform that allows people to support creators on a recurring basis.

In my previous street food tour videos of Chengdu, China, we’ve brought you to hundreds of delicious street food locations. We’ve shot hundreds of Chinese street food tour videos. You’ve watched us eat CRAZY Chinese street food like GIANT LOBSTERS and HUGE KING CRABS, massive bowls of dan dan noodles and more, but today, we’re upgrading and going ALL OUT for a $300 per person splurge at Chengdu’s best restaurant; Yuzhilan, owned by the best Sichuan chef in China, mr Lan.Chef Lan has been working his craft and cooking the best Szechuan cuisine in China for over 35 years, and today, he’s bringing us in to his home kitchen to see how he makes some very special dishes. He is sharing with us his philosophy of cooking and his deep love for Sichuan cuisine, sharing his personal story of learning how to cook Sichuan food and how he has traveled the world to study how to cook. After living in Japan for 2 years and studying in London, he has spend his life perfecting the art of Sichuan cuisine, using only the best local ingredients to bring out the natural flavour in everything he prepares.As soon as we walked into his kitchen, Chef Lan showed us how he prepared his abalone. He explained to us the significance of Abalone in Hong Kong and Guangdong cuisine and how he has used 4 different styles of cooking abalone to bring into his own Sichuan style. It was amazing to watch the stock bubbling and the soft abalone simmering away.After this, Chef lan showed us the AMAZING Kung Lao LOBSTER! A dish he is proud of and worked hard to master, the kung pao lobster was amazing to witness. It was spicy and sweet and served cold with a bowl of guaiweimian AKA cold “strange flavour” noodles.As the lobster was being plated, Chef Lan brought us into his main noodle preparation area, where he uses a MASSIVE blade to hand cut the THINNEST noodles in the WORLD! This was so incredible to watch! Just like watching a taiqi master practice his moves, watching Chef Lan cut the noodles was an unforgettable experience! After he cut the noodles, Chef Lan showed us how each noodle could fit through the thread of a needle!And then it was time to eat this AMAZING Sichuan food! Luxury Sichuan food at it’s finest! There were over 20+ items on the menu, all cooked in Sichuan style yet upgraded flavour wise because all the ingredients were so premium!Chef Lan’s personal philosophy in cooking Sichuan food is to use the best ingredients and to allow them to do the talking and use the sauces only to lightly touch and improve the flavour. We could see that is true on his huge Sichuan food menu:Some of the crazy LUXURY Sichuan foods we ate were: Hot Pot Chicken, chinese Matsutake mushrooms with chinese yam and soup, SUPERIOR Abalone, Hot and Sour DEEP Sea cucumber, Chinese bird’s nest soup, Yuxiang Style Eggplant and Yuxiang style eel, Sichuan dry style rabbit with Sichuan pepper and fermented soya bean, KUNG PAO Lobster, Sichuan Caviar, and more!!

thiOicCQRWY,Why we fear the food we eat | Jack Bobo | TEDxTysons,"Pesticides, chemicals, cancer - the world is a scary place and our dinner plate even more so. Or so it seems. Despite what we hear in the media and find in our Facebook feed, food in the United States has never been safer. Why is it then that American consumers have never been more worried about the safety of the foods they eat? Jack Bobo, Vice President for Global Policy at Intrexon Corporation, travels the world discussing the future of food and how to sustainably and nutritiously feed the world in 2050. Before joining Intrexon, Jack spent 13 years at the U.S. Department of State as a senior advisor for global food policy. He was named by Scientific American as one of the 100 most influential people in biotechnology for his work on food trends and the psychology of consumer behavior. In his talk, Jack reveals a startling truth about why we fear the food we eat and how the choices we make affect our personal health and the health of the planet. By recognizing the ways our mind misleads us, we can improve our choices, which might just help us save the planet.  This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx",food

We visited Dubai in the UAE to try some traditional Emirati Cuisine, and joined up with our friend Peyman to eat a whole camel platter with rice and eggs!►Check out Peyman's Channel Here: http://bit.ly/PeymanSubscribeThis is a traditional Emirati meal that is usually reserved for special occasions or very exclusive guests. It's not a normal Dubai Street Food, but that's why it's so good. It is an extremely rare Arab food nowadays! You have to be incredibly lucky to experience this whole camel platter! This is definitely one of the must try foods in Dubai! It is a traditional Emirati food and is one of the best things to do in Dubai. Camel meat is something that may be sensitive to some viewers, so make sure you're comfortable with watching the camel cooking! The chefs who prepared the camel recipe were originally from the South of India in Kerala, but have been living in Dubai for over 20 years.If you're thinking of traveling to Dubai for a food trip, you can't go wrong, there is so much delicious Emirati cuisine and amazing street food to try! I must admit, most of the food is in Dubai restaurants that are clean and quiet, but that is part of the charm of Dubai.First, Peyman and I checked out the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa, and then made our way to the one and only Camel Restaurant, address below:Entire Camel Platter in Dubai: Zaman Awal RestaurantAddress: Al Boom Village, Dubai, UAE, United Arab EmiratesIf you're wondering if you should eat street food in Dubai or go for regular restaurants in Dubai, I recommend mixing it up and going for both.

Xdya8eym9nM,"Street Food in Pakistan - ULTIMATE 16-HOUR PAKISTANI FOOD Tour in Lahore, Pakistan!","Thank you to Ali (Pakistan Travel Market): https://goo.gl/VY6NjHSUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos every week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribeT-shirts and caps: https://goo.gl/6WdK1lAlso, just published a full Pakistan travel guide: https://goo.gl/5MHgz4I’m very excited to share this first full street food in Pakistan video with you! We started our trip in Lahore, a vibrant, colorful, and packed full of food city. Our first day in Lahore turned out to be a 16 hour street food marathon in Lahore, and it was an amazing day!Get more details on my Pakistan Travel Guide: https://goo.gl/5MHgz4Sadiq Halwa Puri (https://goo.gl/maps/Yoy9dJ6steF2) - We began the day with a very common breakfast throughout Pakistan, halwa puri, but along with chana curry (chickpea curry). We ate off the car, enjoying every bit of the freshly fried puris and curry.Total price - 640 PKR ($4.78)Chacha Feeka Lassi (https://goo.gl/maps/RGQBRQaNj8p) - Next we drove over to Gawalmandi, one of the most legendary areas in Lahore for food. We headed straight to a breakfast staple, the lassi shop and had the most creamy heavy milkshake I’ve ever had, called a pera lassi.Roasted chickpeas - 25 PKR ($0.19) - After exiting an alley, right in front of us was a man selling chickpeas and corn roasted in black Himalayan salt. It’s a very common street food snack in Pakistan.Sweet potato - 80 PKR ($0.60) - Sweet potato is also a very common street food snack in Lahore, seasoned with masala and a type of citrus juice.Baba Kulfi Wala - Next we headed over to Shah Alami Market, another huge and bustling market in Lahore.Kulfi - 20 PKR ($0.15) each - One of the most famous places to eat ice cream in Lahore is Baba Kulfi Wala, and you’ll find a crowd of people standing around the corner of the road eating sticks of their famous kulfi.Orange juice - 50 PKR ($0.37)Chana chaat - 120 PKR ($0.89) per plate - One of my personal favorite Pakistani street food snacks of the day was chana chaat, a chickpea snack. He added in all sorts of spices, chutneys, and seasonings, to create a deliciously refreshing snack.Butt Karahi Tikka Restaurant - Easily one of the most well known restaurants in Lahore is Butt Karahi, specializing in curry made in a rounded pan, called a karahi (we will be eating a lot of karahi’s in Pakistan!). We ordered both a mutton karahi and chicken karahi. Both were amazing, filled with spices and butter, but the tenderness of the mutton was the winner.Total price - 5,600 PKR ($41.84)Siddique Fish Corner - You’ll notice that Lahore seems to come alive at night, and street food is everywhere at night. We began the evening with Siddique Fish Corner, one of the best fried fish stalls in Lahore. It was awesome, and so busy.Total price - 400 PKR ($2.99)Khalifa Balochi Sajji - Another Pakistani dish I wanted to try was chicken sajji, a type of hand rotisserie chicken. The atmosphere and cooking method was incredible.Total price - 390 PKR ($2.91)Khan Baba Restaurant - Finally for our last dinner on this 16 hour day of food in Pakistan, we went to one of Ali’s favorite restaurants in Lahore, Khan Baba. The goat chops were impressive as was the korma curry.Again, massive thank you to Ali, from Pakistan Travel Mart for hosting us in Pakistan, taking us around, and organizing everything.

C5U3dMkYbog,"GIANT BEEF RIBS and Brisket - AMERICAN FOOD BBQ at Little Miss BBQ in Phoenix, AZ!","Little Miss BBQ serves unbelievable BBQ meat in Phoenix!►SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe►T-shirts available now: https://migrationology.com/store/Phoenix, Arizona, USAFor me, one of the ultimate American food meals to eat is awesome BBQ - when the meat is smoked perfectly so it slides off the bone, and the flavor is packed full of insane smokiness. My brother in law Derek had already been to Little Miss BBQ, but it was my first time to eat here, and I was so excited.I arrived a little over an hour early to get in line, but luckily as soon as you pull up you get a number so that you don’t actually have to wait in line the entire time. Scott and the entire crew at Little Miss BBQ are amazing, and you can immediately feel their passion and their genuine love for what they do and for the people they get to interact with everyday as a result of serving the best BBQ in Phoenix! Scott and his wife have an interesting and amazing grassroots history and start to their BBQ business. They first started making BBQ at home just because they loved doing it. Eventually they started competing in American BBQ competitions. At the beginning things didn’t go so well, but they kept going and perfecting their BBQ recipes and eventually started to win some of the competitions. Eventually they opened Little Miss BBQ, and it’s one of the best BBQ spots you’ll ever eat at.So after getting the full tour of the restaurant and all the smoked meat, it was about time to open. You line up outside and the actual inside is quite small - most people either takeaway or eat outside.I wanted to try a little of everything, so we got a giant tray of smoked BBQ meat including pork ribs, pulled pork, turkey, sausage, brisket, and beef ribs, with sides. Total price for the entire tray came to $92.70 - that was a lot of meat!Thanks to my brother in law Derek for coming out to eat as well. We started with the beef ribs, and those are the best of the best. The meat falls apart and it was so insanely juicy and flavorful. The BBQ brisket will also blow you mind with its massive meaty flavor and juiciness. Finally my other top meat was the sausage, including jalapeno and a mix of meat and bacon.Lastly, you have to eat your American food bbq feast with their famous pecan pie. And even though I’m not into sweets, a few bites at the end was amazing.Little Miss BBQ is a phenomenal BBQ restaurant in Phoenix, Arizona. Not only will the quality and taste of the meat blow you away, but the passion of Scott and the entire crew are so genuine and so friendly, and that’s what makes it so good.Thank you for watching this BBQ video!MUSIC: Turn on my Swag -  https://goo.gl/HwVjdo***CAMERA GEAR*** I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2EjBeEgMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: http://amzn.to/2CrtAHzI would love to connect with you!Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyT-shirts available now: https://migrationology.com/store/",food

wZz11Y2CAPo,"INSANE Chinese Seafood - $1500 Seafood FEAST in Guangzhou, China - 10 KG BIGGEST Lobster + KING Crab","INSANE Chinese Seafood FEAST in Guangzhou! We found the most CRAZY Chinese Seafood in Guangzhou. This Chinese seafood restaurant is like a huge seafood Aquarium!  There is so much EXOTIC Chinese seafood here! This is like upgraded Chinese street food! GIANT Seafood HEAVEN!If you're wanting to eat seafood in Guangzhou, you can come to Guangzhou HongXing restaurant. It has the most INSANE selection of Chinese seafood from around the world, all picked up daily from the local fish market! They have every type of seafood you can order it in a huge variety of different cooking styles. When you walk into hongxing seafood restaurant, you immediately feel like you're walking into a seafood heaven. This is different from our regular Chinese street food videos, this is a  Chinese seafood feast video! And today we are featuring all cantonese style cooking, one of the 8 main specialties of Chinese cuisine! This is less spicy than Sichuan food, this is much more elegant and refined and clear style, very delicious!When you walk in, you'll see hundreds of different fish tanks full of so many different types of seafood to choose from.You'll see at least 2 aisles full of lobster from around the world. Australian lobster, Boston lobster, and more. And you'll also find aisles full of different crabs from around the world. The biggest ones are the Alaskan king prawns. You can order these steamed or boiled and covered in a garlic sauce.  The crab legs are full of flesh! Super tasty! This is Chinese style seafood mukbang! This is way better than a regular seafood boil!You'll also find rows of different clams, mussels, abalone, oysters, and more exotic things too. There is water beetles, snakes,  and also classic Cantonese stir fry dishes too. You can eat dim sum, fried noodles, and cantonese desserts too!This is one of the most expensive restaurants in Guangzhou for seafood. In my opinion, if you can afford to spend a little for one crab, it is totally worth it to taste the cantonese style of cooking.

n19N6bECRQM,Tokyo's Monster Food Challenge ★ ONLY in JAPAN #20 東京大食いチャレンジ,"Japan is the last place you'd think to find gigantic portions of food, but you'll be surprised to hear that many restaurants offer food challenges! Sometimes what you've given just isn't enough, right? Best of all, if you eat it all within a certain amount of time, it's usually free! John Daub and Kai Okudara head to Iidabashi Station and the Kagurazaka Hanten (神楽坂飯店) restaurant known for its jumbo gyoza and other food challenges. It's a 10 min walk from the Tokyo Dome or 1 stop on the Oedo Line subway. Most people notice the challenge in the display window. It looks almost like a joke! It's ridiculously big. THE CHALLENGE: ★ Jumbo Gyoza / 2.5kg. / 60 minutes / ￥9600 ★ Triple Jumbo Ramen / 3.2kg. / 60 minutes / ￥1890* It's free if you complete the challenge* Jumbo Gyoza should be ordered 2 days in advance * Enter the Wall of Fame if you complete the challengeWhy are food portions in Japanese usually small? We talk about the Japanese concept of mottainai もったいない which means ""take only what you need"" and ""don't waste"" This concept runs deep with Japanese and is followed closely with almost every citizen. Kagurazaka Hanten started this challenge 45 years ago as a PR stunt for students. It was a way to get them in to the restaurant in groups and have fun. Today, the restaurant is featured often on Japanese TV as Japanese talent test the limits of their stomachs. ★ Watch Other ONLY in JAPAN FOOD CHALLENGES ★ ☆ Highway Rest Area Food Challenge https://youtu.be/ZSm1InvSMBA☆ Stinky Sushi Eating Challenge https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EI5Jv...☆ Ice Cream Flavor Challenge https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP-B1...URL: Kai's Instagram: http://instagram.com/sneakermaniaKagurazaka Hanten (神楽坂飯店) telephone: 03-3260-1402This show has been created and produced by John Daub.

MUy8Xf3_AtA,Chinese Street Food HOT POT HEAVEN + RABBIT Noodles and SPICY Dumplings in China - CHILI OIL 4 LIFE!,"Chinese Street Food in Chengdu, China is the BEST in the WORLD! ► BRAND NEW Chili Oil 4 Life Merch here:  https://www.thefoodranger.com/Chilioi...In this Chinese street food tour of Chengdu, China, we're bringing you to eat at 4 classic Chengdu foods. Chinese cooking is some of the best in the world, and in Chengdu, China, the cuisine is world famously known as Sichuan cuisine or Szechuan cuisine. It is spicy and numbing and covered in delicious Chili oil. I moved here to Chengdu specifically to be able to eat spicy and delicious Chinese street foods. ►For addresses a full Chengdu Food Tour, visit my blog post on Chengdu street food, it has a huge list of the best street foods to try in Chengdu, China. The Chengdu food guide features all of the locations within this Chinese street food video: ►https://www.thefoodranger.com/the-ult...In this Chinese street food tour video, we're starting out with one of China's most famous foods; DUMPLINGS. In Chengdu, they are different from the rest of China. Here, they are boiled and covered in a thick and spicy chili oil that leaves you so SATISFIED! These are some of the most satisfying dumplings ever! I must admit though, the filling could have been more plump. If you are traveling to Chengdu to eat Szechuan cuisine, I would personally recommend trying the red chili oil wontons first. And after those amazing dumplings in Chengdu, we're eating another famous dish in Sichuan cuisine, RABBIT. Eating rabbit is very famous in Sichuan, and here in Chengdu, locals love it in a numbing and spicy Szechuan Sauce. But we wanted to try a more UNIQUE style of eating rabbit in Sichuan, on top of noodles. So we visited a local rabbit noodle joint and ate a couple unique bowls of Chinese Sichuan noodles. The first was the rabbit noodles, where the rabbit is served to you in thin slices covered in chilies, ginger, and onions. You then pour it over top of your thick and spicy chili oil broth noodle bowl. It was absolutely delicious. The next bowl of spicy noodles that we ordered was the beef noodle soup - red braised beef noodle soup. Super delicious and spicy!After eating those 2 bowls of delicious Sichuan noodles, we are bringing you to a nice original fly restaurant of Chengdu, Mingting fandian. The fly restaurants of Chengdu are old locations that are sometimes less than cleanly but have incredible food! Nowadays most fly restaurants in Chengdu are actually really clean and you don't have to worry about getting sick from eating the street food. At mingting restaurant, we ordered a river carp,  spicy pork blood, spare ribs, fried sticky rice strips, Sichuan sausages, twice cooked pork, and pig brain tofu. It was all incredibly delicious!And for our final meal in this Chinese street food tour of Chengdu, China, we're going for one of the most famous foods to try in Sichuan, HOT POT! We found a local 9 section hot pot that serves spicy and delicious hot pot and is always busy!

A multicultural display of extremely delicious specialty food is available for eating. Within Malaysian street food, there is Malay Street food, Chinese Street Food, and Indian street food all available to try and the options are endless. Kuala Lumpur street food is some of the best in the world. Street food around the world is different everywhere, but what is so special about Malaysia is how multicultural everything is and how unique the cooking and food culture is. So for my 3rd trip to Malaysia, we came for a Kuala Lumpur food tour. Chuchu and I decided to travel to Malaysia on a 4 day eating vacation to eat as much street food and local specialties as we could. One thing that we both fell in love with about Malaysian cuisine, is that you could really spend a lifetime eating here tasting the local varieties of Chinese food, Indian Food, and Malay Food. With our limited amount of time on this trip, we ate non stop to sample all of the Kuala Lumpur food available. That being said, in 4 days, we barely scratched the surface of Malaysian food, there is so much more!We visited a few famous Chinese cuisine places, a few famous Malay cuisine places, and of course some amazing Indian cuisine as well.Below are the addresses for the Malaysian cuisine that we sampled in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia:1) Chinese Indian Food (Fish Head Curry) - PUDU CHINESE INDIAN RICE @ RESTORAN SIN HIAP KEE2) Nasi Campur and Ikan Bakar @ Gerai Pak Lang Ikan Bakar - Kampung Baru3) Malaysian dessert street Cendol 4) Malaysian Nasi Lemak at Village Park 5) Banana Leaf Rice at Sri Paandi in Little India (Brickfields)6) Nasi Dagang only open on the weekends at Nasi Dagang Warung Terengganu6) Ooi Noodle House famous Pork Noodle7), Jalan SS 15/4b, Ss 15, 47500 Subang Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia8)Restoran Home Cooking @ Sungai Way, PJ - near the Indian temple at Sungai Way9) Durian at SS2 Durian Wai’s Durian10) Dry Bak Kut Teh AKA Rougucha @ Yap Chuan Bak Kut Teh, Puchong11) Roti Canai at Nasi Kandar PelitaMY GEAR AND RESOURCES + MERCH► New Camera (AWESOME 4K) : https://amzn.to/2MnyBsg► Main Lens: https://amzn.to/2MjnuAr► Great Second Lens (FOR CLOSEUPS): https://amzn.to/2ntJvhG► Favourite Telephoto: https://amzn.to/2vy3lwU► Take everywhere cam: https://amzn.to/2P0b2Eb► Action Cam (WATERPROOF) https://amzn.to/2Macjec► Audio Setup (GREAT for clear voice): https://amzn.to/2MgzYJc► Memory Card (for 4K footage): https://amzn.to/2OZrOTO► Editing Computer (SUPER FAST): https://amzn.to/2M9nIuD► Main External Hard Drive: https://amzn.to/2OXr4P3► Main SSD Hard Drive: https://amzn.to/2OZOyTS► How I Access The Internet ANYWHERE: https://amzn.to/2vv0TY3► MUSIC I USE (Great For YouTubers): http://bit.ly/FoodRangerMusic►BEST VPN FOR CHINA (ACCESS YOUTUBE): http://bit.ly/AccessYouTubeinChina► MERCH AVAILABLE HERE: https://shop.bonfire.com/thefoodranger/ABOUT THE FOOD RANGER-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------My name is Trevor James and I'm a hungry traveler and Mandarin learner that's currently living in Chengdu, Szechuan, China,  eating up as much delicious .I enjoy tasting and documenting as many dishes as I can and I'm going to make videos for YOU along the way!

SU4kNMXG3Rc,"Chinese Street Food LEVEL 9000 -The ULTIMATE Chinese Street Food Tour of Chengdu, China - SICHUAN!","Chinese Street Food Chengdu http://bit.ly/Chengdu8Chinese Street Food Level 9000 - The Ultimate Chinese Street Food Tour in Chengdu, China! This is Sichuan Food HEAVEN!In this Chinese Street Food Tour video, we’re bringing you in DEEP to try 4 amazing Chinese street foods in Chengdu. Here, the Sichuan food is world famous for being SPICY, Fragrant, and a little numbing as well from the Sichuan peppercorn.Today, we’re going for a street food adventure to these 4 street food stalls to taste some delicious and spicy street foods and also a famous Sichuan dessert.We’re starting first thing in the morning for Chinese breakfast and going to a famous Sichuan Noodle Joint in Chengdu. This noodle restaurant is famous for its twice cooked pork noodles AKA huiguoroumian 回锅肉面.Huiguorou twice cooked pork is a famous Sichuan food that is best in Chengdu. And to find it on top of noodles is very RARE. To me it’s like an upgraded dan dan noodle. The flavour is even stronger and more aromatic. And we were so lucky to get into the kitchen to watch the chef Mr.Yu cook his family recipe and serve it to us!After this, we found the true Chinese Street Food LEVEL 9000 dish, the sweet sticky rice balls AKA Tangyou Guozi 糖油果子. Tangyou guozi are a very traditional Chinese street food in Chengdu that you need to try. The sticky rice balls are fried in a huge wok full of oil for about 10 minutes and then covered in a dark sweet molasses. They are crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside, and are incredibly sweet!After this, we’re continuing our journey for another famous Chinese street food - WONTONS. And today, we got invited into the prep area of a famous wonton restaurant in a little neighbourhood of Chengdu. This restaurant serves a variety of special wontons famous in Sichuan cuisine. Watching the master chefs prepare these elegant and expensive wontons was a highlight of our Chinese street food adventure. They are most well known for their ganhaijiao chaoshou AKA spicy wontons covered in peanut and chili. You can order them dry or with stock. I prefer them dry. They also had two other amazing wonton dishes, one made with pork and another made with shrimp, pork, and crab egg, kind of like a Seafood wonton! Each of these were made with a chicken stock and served with either matsutake mushrooms or local fungus. And to finish off our Chinese street food LEVEL 9000 Adventure - we’re going to the most famous Szechuan food of all, the Szechuan hot pot! Here in Chengdu, you can get extremely spicy and flavourful Sichuan hot pot almost anywhere. But we set out to find the most local style one and found a little place in a small neighbourhood in Chengdu. It was definitely one of the BEST hot pot restaurants in Chengdu! It was very spicy and flavourful and full of chili and Sichuan peppercorn!All the addresses for this Chinese Street Food LEVEL 9000 Tour of Sichuan China are found in my Chengdu Food Tour Post here: https://www.thefoodranger.com/the-ult...You can follow along on the Chengdu food tour map and take yourself on a Foodrangin’ adventure!

_qhIT8sOymk,How Long Foods Stay In Your Stomach,"How long does the process of digestion last? Do you find yourself still hungry no matter how much you eat? If so, you might be eating foods that are too high on the glycemic index. It’s definitely something worth knowing if you’re struggling with excess weight.  The glycemic index is a system of values given to foods according to how quickly they cause an increase in blood glucose levels. To put that in layman’s terms, it basically measures how fast different foods are digested by the body. Glucose is a simple sugar that gives your body energy, and you get it from the foods you eat.Your blood is what carries this sugar throughout your body to all your hungry cells and tissues. That’s why it’s called blood glucose. If you eat something that’s high on the index, your blood glucose will spike, giving you a fast boost of energy.TIMESTAMPS: What glycemic index is 0:58Foods that digest slowly 3:30Foods that digest moderately 4:08Foods that digest quickly 4:34 Foods that don’t have a glycemic index value 5:27What about pizza? 6:09 Are all low-glycemic foods healthy? 6:43Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/SUMMARY: - The glycemic index is a system of values given to foods according to how quickly they cause an increase in blood glucose levels. To put that in layman’s terms, it basically measures how fast different foods are digested by the body.- If you eat something that’s high on the index, your blood glucose will spike, giving you a fast boost of energy.- Foods and drinks are actually split into three groups: low, medium, and high. Low items rate from 1 to 55, medium is from 56 to 69, and high items are from 70 and above.- According to the experts at Bodytomy, some low-glycemic foods, like cooked vegetables or a salad, can remain in your stomach anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour.- There are also foods that really don’t really have a glycemic index value since they don’t contain any carbs. But they can still take a while to be digested by your stomach. It can take you anywhere from 2 to 5 hours for your stomach to digest meats, like chicken, lamb, and pork.- If you’re having pizza that’s just dough, cheese, and sauce, that might rate high on the glycemic index, mostly because of that dough. But believe it or not, adding toppings actually makes your slice healthier!- You might encounter foods that will be low on the index, but if they’re processed, they most likely still contain tons of saturated fats, sugar, and empty calories.Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/",food
P2BVyHOdFUo,You Can't Reheat Some Foods Under Any Circumstances,"Is it safe to microwave your food? Let's imagine you went out to dinner last night. Chances are you brought home the leftovers and they’re sitting in your fridge right now. But before you break out the styrofoam carton, pop it in the microwave, and chow down, you should know that there are some foods that actually turn poisonous when reheated! No matter how tasty and healthy your freshly prepared meal is, it can lose its health benefits and even cause food poisoning if you reheat it in a microwave. Bright Side introduces to you a list of foods that you should eat as soon as they’re cooked.Other videos you might like:8 EVERYDAY HABITS THAT DAMAGE YOUR HEALTH https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wNAg...7 Food Combinations That Can Ruin Your Health https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRbhv...18 Harmful Foods We Keep Giving to Children https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qf5Ak...TIMESTAMPS: Mushrooms 0:55Eggs 1:32Rice 3:01Breast milk or formula 3:57Chicken and processed meat 4:57Potatoes 6:21Celery, spinach, and beets 7:22#badforyourhealth #eatitfresh #eathealthyMusic by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/ SUMMARY:- Whether they’re in a soup or stir-fry, reheating mushrooms in the microwave or on the stove is a big no-no. The change in composition can cause you to have an upset stomach, and they also lose their health benefits.- Similarly to mushrooms, eggs are packed with protein that changes once it’s reheated. This can wreak havoc on your digestive system. In fact, eggs can become toxic when exposed to a microwave’s high temperatures.- Even if the rice is cooked, boiling water won’t kill the bacteria. After the rice cools off to room temperature, its bacteria spores can multiply, and reheating it just keeps the bacteria alive. The longer it sat at room temperature, the more likely it is to contain harmful bacteria.- When it’s time to reheat the breast milk, you should never heat it in a microwave because the uneven distribution of heat can create hot spots in the milk, which can seriously burn the poor baby who drinks it.- Just like mushrooms, reheating chicken can change the food’s protein compounds and make you very sick. Unlike other meat (like beef), chicken contains a high amount of protein, which makes reheating it in the microwave a bad idea.-  If you place cooked potatoes directly into the fridge after cooking them, it’s probably safe to reheat them. However, if they sit out at room temperature for a while after they’re prepared, they’re more likely to develop a rare bacteria known as botulism. - While nitrites are dangerous for adults, they’re incredibly dangerous for infants from 0 to 6 months. If they do ingest food with nitrites, they are more likely to develop “blue baby syndrome,” which can be fatal.- Before you stick a leftover sandwich in the microwave, don’t forget to remove any toothpicks the restaurant may have stuck in there! Along with items with sharp tips, metal is a big no-no when it comes to microwave cooking.Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuCPhotos: https://www.depositphotos.comEast News----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/",food

gvHMiduRS-g,10 Foods You Should and Shouldn't Wash Before Cooking,"Since childhood, we’ve been taught to always wash everything we’re about to eat to make it safe for our health. However, very few people know that sometimes this habit does more harm than good. Washing certain foods can spread dangerous bacteria that make their way into your body and wreak havoc on your well-being. You don’t need to wash store-bought eggs since they’ve already been washed during commercial processing. Plus, manufacturers often put special substances on eggs to protect them from bacterial contamination.When you wash chicken or meat, the water helps the bacteria spread to your hands and the kitchen sink. Washing mushrooms isn’t a good idea because the more water mushrooms absorb, the weaker their flavor is. You should also never soak, remove the stalk, or peel them.You absolutely have to wash fruits and vegetables with both edible and inedible skin. Don't soak fruits and vegetables in water, either. This won't clean them but only spread the bacteria. Use running water, it's a safer bet. Just dry the food with a paper towel or a napkin after the “cold shower”.Food will definitely get contaminated if you don't wash the can really well before you open it. You should also always wash fresh nuts before eating them, even if they’re peeled.Music: Seven – Twenty https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/...TIMESTAMPSNever wash these foods:Eggs 0:29Chicken 1:10Meat 2:08Pasta 3:11Mushrooms 3:55Always wash these foods:Fruits and vegetables with edible skin 4:30Fruits and vegetables with inedible skin 5:12Cans 5:58Nuts 6:34Dried fruit 7:21SUMMARY-Don't wash store-bought eggs. You will remove the protective layer so if the shell gets cracked, chances are the egg will become infected.-When you wash chicken, the water helps the bacteria spread to your hands and the kitchen sink.-Just like chicken, you shouldn't wash raw meat, like beef, pork, veal, or lamb, because it’s also covered in bacteria that the water just spreads all around.-Washing pasta is pretty much criminal in the culinary world because the water removes the starch that helps the noodles absorb sauce more effectively.-Washing mushrooms isn’t a good idea because the more water mushrooms absorb, the weaker their flavor is.-Rinse fruits and vegetables with edible skin under regular cold running water to remove 99% of the dangerous bacteria. Dry the food with a paper towel or a napkin after the “cold shower”.-Even if you aren't planning on eating the rind of a lemon or orange, you still need to wash these fruits and also scrub the outside with a clean brush.-Wash your tin cans with soap before you ever open them to prevent their contents from getting contaminated. -Washing nuts helps get rid of the phytic acid they contain. Plus, you never know for sure where they’ve been stored, how they were transported, and how many people touched them at the grocery store.-Even if you bought dried fruit in a nice pretty package, you have to wash it first or soak it for a few hours.Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/",food

DzuOaJ9f8qI,10 Foods You Should Never Eat,"We know some products are really dangerous for our health, and other products are good for us as they are healthy. It turns out it’s not so simple and some of the most promoted and popular foods can, in fact, harm you. Never eat these 10 dangerous foods for the sake of your own health and the health of your family. Even if you see the juice labels “not from concentrate” or “100% pure”, don't let this fool you. Juice, after being squeezed from different fruits, is kept in huge vacuum-sealed tanks where it can sit for up to a year before being packaged! And by that time, the juice has lost all its flavor, which is why manufacturers have to add artificial flavoring to make it taste fruity again.In most cases, cereals are loaded with refined carbohydrates and sugar. Even if the label assures you that it's fat-free and whole grain, check the list of ingredients. You'll most likely see that the product is full of sugar.Despite common belief, most yogurts don't contain probiotic bacteria since the process of pasteurization kills all these microorganisms. When consumed, trans-fats in ice-cream can cause high cholesterol, stroke, heart disease, and even cancer. Ice cream is also loaded with sugar, artificial flavors, and synthetic preservatives. And if it’s pink, purple, or red, it’s most likely been colored with cochineal extract or carmine, additives which can cause bad allergic reactions. Popcorn has some genetically modified ingredients as well as taste-boosting chemicals and additives. This leads to health problems such as heart attacks, digestive issues, allergies, skin rashes, breathing problems, and the depressing list goes on. Even more, popcorn is extremely caloric.Music: Vibe Mountain - Great HopeThe 126ers - Reversed EclipseRondo Brothers - Yellow GoldKevin MacLeod - Jay JaySilent Partner - Pink Lemonadehttps://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/...TIMESTAMPSFruit juices 0:37Energy bars 1:42Cereal 2:31Margarine 3:21Low-fat yogurt 4:11Ice cream 5:01Eggs 6:07Microwave popcorn 7:09Sugar-free candy 8:32Diet soda 9:26SUMMARY-Store-bought juices may contain some real fruit, but most of their content is water, sugar, and artificial flavoring.-Protein bars and energy bars alike are usually processed products containing sugar, artificial flavors and sweeteners.-Breakfast cereals typically contain a teeny tiny amount of whole grains, which allows producers to mark their product as healthy, but they also contain unhealthy sugar. -Margarine is typically made from industrial vegetable oils hydrogenated to become solid, a process that significantly increases the oils’ trans-fat content.-Manufacturers load “low-fat” yogurts with sugar to make up for the lack of taste usually provided by the natural fats.-Instead of pure milk or cream, manufacturers use cheaper hydrogenated fats such as palm- or coconut oil to produce ice-cream. These oils, when heated, become nothing more than trans-fats.-One egg contains as much cholesterol as a big greasy burger.-Microwave popcorn’s almost always lined with the same toxic substance you can find in Teflon pans.-If candy doesn’t contain sugar, it contains artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose, and saccharine. These substances are chemically processed and may cause some serious side effects.-Artificial sweeteners in diet soda can easily lead to weight gain as they trigger the production of insulin, which makes your body store fat.Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/",food

exqcb4DFhzo,Fake Food YOU Eat Every Day!,"Check out this fake food we eat every day! From fake cheese to fake steak, this top 10 list of unhealthy processed food is a real scam! Subscribe For New Videos! http://goo.gl/UIzLeBWatch our ""Most MYSTERIOUS Lost Worlds On Earth!"" video here: https://youtu.be/oX1rLjFYseAWatch our ""Most CREEPY Things Found Frozen In Ice!"" video here: https://youtu.be/HaiYn6wpTPQWatch our ""Most SCARY Mythical Creatures Ever!"" video here: https://youtu.be/LEvBTkPo2R4#10 Prime MeatThe prime cut meats that smaller restaurants and corporations sell are one of the biggest complaints that high-end chefs and physicians make. That’s because ‘prime cut’ suggests that it is a single cut of the best meat from the animal.But this isn’t the case in many restaurants. Actually, what if I told you they chop up all the leftover meat and glue it back together? Does the word transglutaminase ring a bell? This is the name for the meat glue they use to glue the low quality meat back together to make you think you’re getting a full piece. This is more than a lie, this is disgusting. Besides the fact that it is using the worst tiny cuts of meat, it’s made from ammonia. The stuff used in fertilizers and oven cleaners. They try to fight back by claiming it kills E Coli, which should not be something we should be worried about being on meat anyway. Justifying making people unknowingly eat ammonia just so they can pass off scrap meat does not seem ethical in the least. Be very careful where you eat your steak! See, this is why being a vegetarian seems like a safer option! Or maybe seafood….#9 Imitation CrabOr maybe not seafood. For one, crustaceans feed off the worst possible debris on the bottom of the ocean. The only nastier creature is shrimp. This stuff they eat doesn’t magically disappear when they are caught and cooked either. There’s still…stuff in it that we eat…secondhand.Nevertheless, it’s expensive to buy fresh crab and shrimp, but you can get crab cakes and other delicacies at the grocery store for a pretty good price. Why? It’s usually because it is fake, under the guise of imitation crab meat.Imitation crab meat is made from the remains of other fish that are mushed together, and injected into a mold. They mince and mince random fish, whatever they can get their hands on, until it turns into the same texture as crab. It is then created into a paste that is frozen and then shaved into crab-like flakes. To make it taste like crab, they just add flavor and paint it to look like crab. So, next time you go for some cheap crab, remember that’s probably, beaten, frozen, shaved, and painted fish remains. I kind of like imitation crab but not really a fan of this process...it still tastes good so if you’re okay with this…then go ahead. #8 Parmesan CheeseParmesan cheese is delicious! Especially, real authentic parmesan cheese. But did you know that companies will usually lie about what’s in “parmesan”?The FDA regulations make it legal to sell fake Parmesan cheese. This is some scary stuff. There are two huge deal breakers with parmesan. One is grated parmesan in the shaker. Most of the time, cellulose and mold inhibitor chemicals are added so it won’t clump. Cellulose, not cellulite, that’s just an after effect. Cellulose comes from ground up wood pulp and is considered “harmless and organic matter”. They usually add 2-4% cellulose, but the FDA doesn’t restrict it. In fact, some has been proven to carry 20%! That’s a lot of cellulose on your pasta! The saddest part is, this is just allowed in the United States. Parmesan cheese legally means the kind of cheese that comes from Parma, Italy. But in the US, you can call it parmesan when it’s just dehydrated, grated mozzarella.This is like the Kobe beef of cheeses. Most of the time, when you get parmesan, it’s not parmesan. It’s cellulose and a mixture of cheap cheeses.#7 Egg SubstituteThis one is a little different. No one knows what it is, but many believe that it’s a great substitute for people with egg allergies. But really, it’s still just eggs. They take mostly egg whites, fresh, frozen, or powdered, and add other ingredients. But not much. They actually just contain 99% egg whites! There’s not actually much substituting going on. It might be easier for people who don’t want to go to the trouble dealing with egg shells and yolks slipping everywhere, etc. In reality, it is called egg substitute because of that 1% that’s just artificial coloring,  salt, onion powder, and who knows what else. Why? Why would they just flavor egg whites? “Egg substitute” is kind of misleading and should be for people with egg allergies who need a substitute. It shouldn’t just be eggs. Maybe it’s substituting something else? Is it the bottle substituting for the shell? Bottom line is…this isn’t egg substitute, it’s just expensive eggs.",food

e2RBRUFwmuw,Indonesian Street Food Tour of Glodok (Chinatown) in Jakarta - DELICIOUS Indonesia Food!,"►Check out 50 of the Best Indonesian Dishes: https://migrationology.com/indonesian...Glodok is the Chinatown of Jakarta, and my wife and I decided to spend the day walking around Glodok and exploring some Indonesian street food throughout the day. At the end of the day, we also stopped by Fatahillah Square, with is an old Dutch square in colonial Jakarta, where you'll find some interesting buildings and some street food snacks as well.Since we were staying at a hotel (here’s information on the hotel I stayed at:https://migrationology.com/travel-gui...)  not too far from Glodok, we decided to beat the traffic and just walk over there. It didn’t take more than 15 minutes to walk, and soon we arrived in Jakarta’s Chinatown. Glodok is a very interesting area to walk around and explore. There are fresh markets and plenty of restaurants and food to choose from.The Indonesian street food I tried on this tour was siomay, an Indonesian Chinese dish. From the back of a motorbike, I chose a few of the siomay dumplings he had steaming, and the cut them up and added some peanut sauce to the plate. The texture was a little mushy, but they were alright. Right opposite the siomay, the owner of an Indonesian vegetarian restaurant greeted me and asked if I might like to eat some of his vegetarian food. His vegetarian rendang was particularly good.One of the most famous places to go in Glodok is Kopi Es Tak Kie, a legendary coffee shop. After wandering around a while we found it. I had a cup of coffee and also a plate of nasi campur from outside the shop.We continued on our Indonesian street food tour throughout Glodok and I tried a sweet snack called kue ape, which is a green colored little pancake. Next, I had a variety of deep fried snacks including fried bananas, and fried breadfruit. They are definitely pretty greasy, but interesting to sample, and they are very popular street food snacks in Indonesia.It probably wasn’t the greatest idea to walk, but we decided to walk over to Fatahillah Square. The traffic was pretty intense, but we made it. And along with checking out the old colonial buildings one of my main goals was to try kerak telor, which is a traditional Indonesian Betawi street food snack. Luckily I found it and it turned out to be a very interesting and amazing snack to watch being made!Here’s the list of the things we ate and the prices:Siomay - 15,000 IDR ($1.11)Vegetarian food - 20,000 IDR ($1.48)Kopi Es Tak Kie - 10,000 IDR ($0.73) Nasi campur - 35,000 IDR ($2.58)Kue ape - 1,000 IDR ($0.07) eachFried snacks - 12,000 ($0.88)Kerak telor - 20,000 IDR ($1.48) - Possibly overcharged?

The highland farmers talk about their traditions and livestock, their most valuable asset, with great passion and a comparison with the desperation of the city is striking. This juxtaposition restore a sense of worth to the rural subsistence economy, which in this case is able to effectively guarantee food security to the community and provides a concrete example of an integrated approach that puts food at the center of actions to protect biodiversity, community, culture and traditions.The Living Food Communities films are directed by Francesco Amato and Stefano Scarafia and edited by Paolo Casalis for the Bodà production company.Read more about the the 4cities4dev visit the website:http://www.4cities4dev.eu",food

C4gNfcxiBiY,Game of T̶h̶r̶o̶n̶e̶s̶ [Food Trucks]: Chicago's Mobile Vendors in an Epic Food Fight,"Should the city of Chicago be in the business of protecting a few politically connected restaurateurs from competition? That is the question to be answered by a major lawsuit filed Wednesday, November 14, 2012, in Cook County Circuit Court by the Institute for Justice (IJ)—a national public interest law firm—and three Chicago-area food truck entrepreneurs. Cities nationwide are experiencing the benefits of food trucks.  But for years Chicago had not embraced that movement.  For example, Chicago did not allow cooking on food trucks and it told food truck entrepreneurs that they must stay more than 200 feet from brick-and-mortar restaurants.  So in June 2012, when the city announced it would be revising its vending laws, food fans were excited.  The law that passed in July, however, continues to make it illegal for food trucks to operate within 200 feet of any fixed business that serves food.  The fines for violating the 200-foot rule are up to $2,000—ten times higher than for parking in front of a fire hydrant.  Further, the city is forcing food trucks to install GPS tracking devices that broadcast the trucks' every move.  According to the Chicago Tribune, ""the ordinance doesn't serve the needs of the lunch-seeking public. It benefits the brick-and-mortar eateries, whose owners don't want the competition.""The Institute for Justice is the nation's leading legal advocate for the rights of entrepreneurs.

FrboT4icoN8,Garlicky Braised Lamb Shanks with Sweet Peppers | Food & Wine,"In 2018, Food & Wine named this recipe one of our 40 best: Legendary chef Jeremiah Tower has been called the father of California cuisine, both as the chef at Chez Panisse in the 1970s then at his own magnificent San Francisco restaurant, Stars, where this lamb shank dish was first served. Rich, mellow, saucy, and supremely satisfying, it was a dish that caught diners’ eyes as it passed by their table, inspiring them to immediately order it for themselves. At Stars, Tower served the shanks with an aioli flavored with rosemary and mint, but we like to devour them as they are. Tower also advises using a heavy dutch oven just big enough to hold the shanks. The lamb can be braised a day ahead, making the meat extra tender and flavorful. The last-minute addition of fresh bell peppers injects a bright finish to the rich dish.Ingredients4 lamb foreshanks (about 5 pounds) 1 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, divided 1 teaspoon black pepper, divided 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided 12 unpeeled garlic cloves plus  24 peeled garlic cloves (from 4 heads), divided 6 fresh bay leaves 6 thyme sprigs 3 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken stock 1 large red bell pepper, cut into 1/4-inch strips 1 medium-size yellow bell pepper, cut into 1/4-inch strips 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leavesGet the recipe: https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/g...Thanks for watching!

J3H4qIWx9Tc,34 DELICIOUS FOOD HACKS WITH CHEESE AND OTHER GOODIES,"Simple recipes with cheese for everyoneThere is no denying that cheese is delicious, especially when it comes to cooking with cheese. There are limitless recipes you can try with all different varieties of cheese, such as mozzarella, parmesan cheese or cheddar cheese. Since it is such a delicious ingredient for cooking and filled with protein we created some simple and delicious recipes with cheese that can try right away. In addition, we included some bonus cooking hacks and tips to make your time in the kitchen more enjoyable.1. Simplest macaroni and cheese recipe.If you are at work or would like to have macaroni and cheese as a snack instead of making a huge pot of food. Try this little trick that will literally take you 3 minutes to make this meal. In a mug, add a scoop of pasta, then, add the adequate amount of water and microwave for 2 minutes. Stir it really well and make sure there is no more water left in the mug. Then add some milk and cheese and stir until the cheese into the mug and Bon Appetite.2. Delicious cheese toastie recipeIf you would like to have a nice cheese toast fast but you don't own a grill, don't let that stop you. Apply some butter on a slice of bread on both sides, then, add two slices of cheddar cheese and then another slice of bread with butter spread on it. Then, place your sandwich in a kitchen foil and seal it. After that, take your clothing iron and place it on top of the toastie for a couple of minutes max, then turn it and press the other side as well with your clothing iron and, there you have it.3. DIY cheddar sticksThis might as well be the most delicious treat in the whole world. Take a block of cheddar cheese and cut it in rectangular blocks. Place one wooden stick in each block. Then, dip it into flour, after that dip it into an egg wash, and finally in breadcrumbs. Lastly, boil some oil and fry your cheesy sticks. Enjoy with some ketchup or the sauce of your choice.4. Oil Hack!Instead of accidentally pouring excess oil on your food or your frying pan. Pour some oil in a clean spray bottle and start spraying. This way you'll be able to monitor how much oil you consume and also keep your meals healthier.5.How to make your own iced coffeeMake your filter coffee, or your espresso, or your instant coffee with hot water as you would normally do with or without sugar. (Do Not add milk). Then pour it into your ice tray and place it in the freezer. When it's time for you to have a nice glass of iced coffee, instead of running to the closest coffee shop, just take 5-6 cubes of the iced coffee you prepared, place them in a glass with some milk or water and stir.

5RwIWGkMxrE,Food Fight: How Corporations Ruined Food (Food Industry Documentary) - Real Stories,"When we walk into a supermarket, we assume that we have the widest possible choice of healthy foods. But in fact, over the course of the 20th century, our food system was co-opted by corporate forces whose interests do not lie in providing the public with fresh, healthy, sustainably-produced food.Fortunately for America, an alternative emerged from the counter-culture of California in the late 1960s and early 1970s, where a group of political anti-corporate protesters–led by Alice Waters–voiced their dissent by creating a food chain outside of the conventional system. The unintended result was the birth of a vital local-sustainable-organic food movement which has brought back taste and variety to our tables.FOOD FIGHT is a fascinating look at how American agricultural policy and food culture developed in the 20th century, and how the California food movement has created a counter-revolution against big agribusiness.Want to watch more full-length Documentaries?

go_QOzc79Uc,Teach every child about food | Jamie Oliver,"http://www.ted.com Sharing powerful stories from his anti-obesity project in Huntington, W. Va., TED Prize winner Jamie Oliver makes the case for an all-out assault on our ignorance of food.Jamie Oliver is transforming the way we feed ourselves, and our children. Jamie Oliver has been drawn to the kitchen since he was a child working in his father's pub-restaurant. He showed not only a precocious culinary talent but also a passion for creating (and talking about) fresh, honest, delicious food. In the past decade, the shaggy-haired ""Naked Chef"" of late-'90s BBC2 has built a worldwide media conglomerate of TV shows, books, cookware and magazines, all based on a formula of simple, unpretentious food that invites everyone to get busy in the kitchen. And as much as his cooking is generous, so is his business model -- his Fifteen Foundation, for instance, trains young chefs from challenged backgrounds to run four of his restaurants.Now, Oliver is using his fame and charm to bring attention to the changes that Brits and Americans need to make in their lifestyles and diet. Campaigns such as Jamie's School Dinner, Ministry of Food and Food Revolution USA combine Olivers culinary tools, cookbooks and television, with serious activism and community organizing -- to create change on both the individual and governmental level.Join Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution: http://www.jamieoliver.com/campaigns/...TEDTalks is a daily video podcast of the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes.

guxledYcXcE,Processed Food Documentary - Processed Food vs. Nutritional Needs,"Processed Food Documentary: Processed Food vs. Nutritional Needs.The human body runs on food.  Once, food shortage was the major concern.  After the second world war, technological advances in food production led to a new era, that was characterized by an overabundance of inexpensive food, and relatively little physical activity.  In the decades that followed, other sociocultural shifts continued to contribute to the changing way we ate.  Women who had previously controlled most of the average family's food preparation now entered the workforce in significant numbers.  And the processed food industry began to capitalize on our need for fast, convenient food.  This meant that fewer meals were being cooked at home.  And since convenience foods were generally higher in calories than home-cooked meals, the average person's caloric intake increased dramatically.Maya Adam, MD, is waging a battle cry against one of America’s most critical – and challenging – public health crises of our generation: childhood obesity. A lecturer at Stanford School of Medicine and in Stanford University’s human biology program, she is leading the cause through education.As always, use this info to gather more info.Subscribe to this channel - http://www.youtube.com/c/ProperGanderProper Gander on Minds.com - http://www.minds.com/JoelseeJoin Minds.com today: https://www.minds.com/register;referr...Proper Gander on Facebook - http://www.facebook.com/aProperGanderPayPal Donations welcome.

Rjh5aZKgtSY,Food Inc Official HD Trailer,"http://www.foodincmovie.com   In Food, Inc., filmmaker Robert Kenner lifts the veil on our nation's food industry, exposing the highly mechanized underbelly that's been hidden from the American consumer with the consent of our government's regulatory agencies, USDA and FDA. Our nation's food supply is now controlled by a handful of corporations that often put profit ahead of consumer health, the livelihood of the American farmer, the safety of workers and our own environment. We have bigger-breasted chickens, the perfect pork chop, insecticide-resistant soybean seeds, even tomatoes that won't go bad, but we also have new strains of e coli--the harmful bacteria that causes illness for an estimated 73,000 Americans annually.We are riddled with widespread obesity, particularly among children, and an epidemic level of diabetes among adultsFeaturing interviews with such experts as Eric Schlosser (Fast Food Nation), Michael Pollan (The Omnivore's Dilemma) along with forward thinking social entrepreneurs like Stonyfield Farms' Gary Hirschberg and Polyface Farms' Joe Salatin, Food, Inc. reveals surprising -- and often shocking truths -- about what we eat, how it's produced, who we have become as a nation and where we are going from here.",food

iBznPAx6ZJY,Dutch Foods To Try,"Dutch Foods To Try - There are a lot of delicious foods to try in The Netherlands so we put together our own little DIY Dutch food tour to try as many as possible. One special Dutch food to try in The Netherlands is poffertjes - also known as the world’s cutest little pancakes. They are teeny tiny, fluffy, and melt in your mouth. They taste heavenly and you shouldn't miss trying them because they are seriously delicious and unique. I loved seeing how they’re made fresh to order in a poffertjespan. I found watching how they are flipped over super quickly was a bit hypnotic. You can get them with all sorts of toppings. My personal choice was chocolate sauce and powdered sugar. You generally order these by the dozen and you could eat as many and hardly notice because they’re so light and airy, unlike American pancakes. These Dutch cuties were one of my favourite things we tried in The Netherlands. A lot of Dutch snack foods are deep fried. One of the most popular is called a frikandel. It’s basically a minced-meat, skinless sausage that’s deep fried. Very similar to a hot dog. Personally the best part of this snack for me was the sauce. The ‘frinkandel speciaal’ is eaten with mayonnaise, curry ketchup, and chopped onion. It has a nice sweet taste. Another popular Dutch snack food is called a kaassouffle (cheese souffle). It’s melted cheese, usually Gouda, inside a doughy wrap that’s then deep fried. Cheese is important in The Netherlands and eaten widely. I have yet to see a Dutch refrigerator without a huge block of Gouda in it. Along with the poffertjes, the kaassouffle was my favourite Dutch snack food we tried. It’s pretty much deep fried cheese so what’s not to love?Krokets are a Dutch food you’ll see everywhere and they look similar at first glance to a kaassouffle. A kroket is usually cylindrical and filled with meat. As you might have guessed, it’s also deep fried. It’s long been an economical way to use leftovers of meat stew and roasts which are then mixed with gravy, rolled into logs, breaded, and fried. It became really popular during World War II as a cheap food. It’s crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Stroopwaffel is quintessentially Dutch. It means syrup waffle and is made by baking a thin waffle and, while it’s still warm, breaking it in two. Then a warm caramel-like filling is added before the two halves are pushed back together, using the syrup as glue. They’re very popular to eat on their own or with other sweets. We also tried Surinamese and Javanese food, which is widely available in The Netherlands. Suriname and Indonesia were colonized by the Dutch and I was excited to try this type of food as I had never seen it before. My sample dish came with chicken, potato, hard boiled egg, noodles with peanut sauce, rice, vegetables and bread. For dessert, we had a deep fried banana with peanut sauce. I also tried a Surinamese soda called Cherry Bouquet but it was way too sweet for me - even though I have a massive sweet tooth. I included fries in this video even though they’re Belgian, not Dutch. But they’re really popular in The Netherlands and I didn’t think I could make a video about foods to try there without including fries. Make sure you try them with lots of different sauces. My favourite is truffle mayonnaise followed closely by curry mayonnaise. I hope that you enjoyed seeing these different Dutch foods to try in The Netherlands. I’d love to know which food you’d most like to try if you had the opportunity. Or, if you’ve already tried them, which is your favourite?Subtitles available in English and Spanish!

RwZY1jaw2EM,Food Matters (PART 1) - First 8 Minutes,"Dear Friend,What you're about to learn could likely save your life, or that of someone you love. This was certainly the case with my Father. About 6 years ago my Father was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Depression and Anxiety. The best the medical profession could offer was a cocktail of medications to treat the symptoms and little in the way of hope for treating the underlying causes. Not surprisingly his health continued to decline.At the same time we were studying nutrition and sending my father many books we had read but these didn't seem to help convince him. So for the next 12 months (with 3 years of research up our sleeves) we set about creating the independent documentary film 'Food Matters'.'Food Matters' features interviews with leading health experts who reveal the best natural healing choices you can make for you and your family's health. In the film you'll discover what works, what doesn't and what's killing you.Needless to say after my father saw the film he quit his pharmaceutical meds, changed his diet, lost 20% of his body weight and is now running 3 times a week which is a big change from being bed ridden for 5 years!Thank you for your support in helping this lifesaving information reach more people, it would not be possible without you.James Colquhoun & Laurentine ten BoschProducer / Directors 'Food Matters'PS: You don't have to take our word for it, here is what others are saying about the film.  ""Everything I have been harping on for the last 40 years, these two have brilliantly encapsulated in one beautifully produced, eminently watchable video."" - Harvey Diamond, Author of America's best selling health book 'Fit For Life'""This film lays out the inconvenient truth the food industry doesn't want you to hear -- that nearly all degenerative disease is actually caused by the processed, nutrient-depleted food being consumed in first-world nations around the world. 'Food Matters' dares to reveal how we can stop this cycle of destruction and restore true health to ourselves and our planet."" - Mike Adams founder of Natural News.com ""Anyone who is serious about their health needs to see this stunning film.""- Christiane Northrup, MD, author of the Women's Wisdom series ""James and Laurentine provide a radiant beacon of hope with steps you can do today to take control of your health and begin healing. This is such important information - and much aligned with my personal health philosophies. It's time to get it out to everyone who will listen. I encourage you to order a copy of Food Matters today and watch it with your friends and family.""- Dr Joseph Mercola - Mercola.com",food

Rob is on a mission to solve this problem.  We can all easily be a part of the solution… and it starts with a dumpster.TEDxTeen opening music by BlackDoeRob is an adventurer, activist, and dude making a difference. His purpose is to inspire health, happiness, and freedom on Earth and he’s dedicated his life to this mission. He has cycled across the United States, twice, on a bamboo bicycle, went 1,000 days without showering, and has dove into thousands of dumpsters across America, all to inspire positive social and environmental change. When not out adventuring he lives off the grid in a fifty-square-foot tiny home in San Diego. His extreme adventures and activism campaigns may appear unattainable at first glance but within them are an abundance of simple lessons and tips that can be adapted into any life to live with more happiness, health, and freedom.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

awtmTJW9ic8,Food for thought: How your belly controls your brain | Ruairi Robertson | TEDxFulbrightSantaMonica,"""Have you ever had a gut feeling or butterflies in your stomach? Has hunger ever changed your mood? Our bellies and brains are physically and biochemically connected in a number of ways, meaning the state of our intestines can alter the way our brains work and behave, giving a whole new meaning to 'Food for thought'. As a nutritionist, microbiologist and neuroscientist, Ruairi Robertson is passionate about the link between our bellies and brains. His research is examining how our intestines and the microbes within them can influence both physical and mental health, and most importantly how our diets influence this relationship. Ruairi has travelled the world researching food, and believes it is the key to global public health. Ruairi is a PhD student in University College Cork in Ireland and current Fulbright Scholar (2015/16) to Harvard University.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

YBN29Q1xDH8,"Top 10 Indian Street Foods in Mumbai, India | The BEST INDIAN Street Food in Mumbai","Back in early 2018, I spent three unforgettable weeks traveling through India and exploring its cities and historical sites, immersing myself in the culture, and going on as many street food tours as I possibly could. Subscribe & Click the Bell for 2+ Videos Per Week ► http://bit.ly/DBH-SUBMy Film Making Kit ► https://kit.com/davidsbeenhereI spent three days eating my way through Mumbai, the most populous city in India. In this video, I’m going to tell you all about the top 10 street foods you have to try when you visit Mumbai. You guys ready? Let’s do this. Pani puri, which I first tried at Elco restaurant in the Bandra neighborhood of Mumbai. Panipuri is a round, hollow ball of crispy, fried bread that is punctured and then filled with a soup that can contain chili, tamarind chutney, chaat masala, chickpeas, onion, and potatoes.  Bombay duck, which is a local specialty in Mumbai that I tried at Mata Pita Da Dhaba on Madh Island. Now, you might be surprised to learn that Bombay Duck actually isn’t duck at all. It’s a fish that’s either deep fried or cooked in curry, and cut into strips almost like fish sticks. It’s soft, lightly battered, and crispy, and kind of reminded me of flounder. Ice Gola, a cold, sweet, and salty treat made of shaved ice. The vendor molds the ice around a wooden stick and then dips it into a cup that’s filled with your choice of fruit flavorings. The one I had was blueberry and lemon, which I loved. It made for a unique and delicious combination along with the salt.  Kalidas Masala Vada Pav, a vegetarian Masala burger I tried in the Mulund neighborhood of Mumbai. The burger was made by mixing several ingredients together on a hot pan, including butter, Masala, coriander, and herbs, and cooking it until it reduces into a thick sauce or paste.  Nitrogen Biscuit, which I ate at the Ice Cream Factory, also in the Mulund neighborhood. It’s a freezing cold biscuit that’s been dipped in liquid nitrogen. Eating one of these bizarre desserts is a spectacle because as you chew the biscuit, the heat from your mouth turns the liquid nitrogen into a gas, which makes you look like you’re breathing smoke. My teeth were frozen afterward! Ice Bhel is a cold, refreshing chaat dish that contains a mouthwatering blend of tomatoes, onions, puffed rice, garlic paste, and coriander. It’s crunchy and super flavorful, and not spicy at all, and is my favorite thing I tried on my first night in Mumbai.Paneer Chili, which is a very popular Indo-Chinese dish I tried at Juhu Beach. It is made of cubes of deep fried cottage cheese, Chinese sauces, lots of vegetables including bell pepper and spring onions, chili paste, and a whole lot of deliciousness. I was told it would be really hot, but I didn’t find it particularly spicy. That said, it is bursting with flavor with every bite, and I cannot recommend it enough. Chicken Lollipop, which I tried along Mohammad Ali Road. This is a fried chicken drumstick that’s covered in a red curry that’s so rich, it actually changes the color of the chicken. When you hold the drumstick upright by the bone, it resembles a lollipop, which is how the dish got its name.  Now, further along Mohammad Ali road, you can find the second-to-last items on this list, mutton and chicken kebabs. Mutton is the meat of a mature sheep, and the most common type of kebab is either meat or vegetables that are speared on a skewer and grilled over a fire. The kebabs I had were made of soft, spicy, minced meat and came with a refreshing salad on the side. The last food on my list is another I tried along Mohammad Ali Road called Lassi, which is a creamy yogurt drink that was not only refreshing because of the heat in Mumbai, but it was also perfect for cooling down my mouth and throat after a long day of eating spicy foods. I tried two different flavors - the original and the saffron. I preferred the original, but my friends loved the saffron.  Now, if you’re heading off to India to try the street food, I highly recommend you take a dose of Pepto Bismol before breakfast and another before lunch every day so you don’t get sick from eating foods and spices your body is not used to.

4xD3wfp1LAA,Japanese Street Food - LIVE FUGU PUFFERFISH Puffer Fish Japan,"Fugu (河豚 or 鰒; フグ) is the Japanese word for pufferfish and the dish prepared from it, normally species of genus Takifugu, Lagocephalus, or Sphoeroides, or porcupinefish of the genus Diodon. Fugu can be lethally poisonous due to its tetrodotoxin; therefore, it must be carefully prepared to remove toxic parts and to avoid contaminating the meat.The restaurant preparation of fugu is strictly controlled by law in Japan and several other countries, and only chefs who have qualified after three or more years of rigorous training are allowed to prepare the fish. Domestic preparation occasionally leads to accidental death.Fugu is served as sashimi and chirinabe. Some consider the liver to be the tastiest part, but it is also the most poisonous, and serving this organ in restaurants was banned in Japan in 1984. Fugu has become one of the most celebrated and notorious dishes in Japanese cuisine.",food

eF5LVBW1vl8,Manufacturing plywood boards: then and now,"Plywood is a simple material made by glueing together thin sheets of wood, known as veneers or plies. These basic elements have remained broadly the same throughout its history. The most significant breakthrough in its production came in the early 1800s with the development of steam-powered machines that could cut veneers cheaply. The most influential of these was the rotary veneer cutter.The cutter rotates a log against a wide, horizontal blade, causing it to ‘peel’ into a continuous sheet of wood. This enables the creation of longer, wider sheets of veneer than previously possible and with little waste. Using these machines meant that plywood could be manufactured quickly and inexpensively on a large scale.This film shows the stages in manufacturing plywood boards in the mid-20th century and today. The process remains essentially unchanged, although today many of the machines are much faster and computer controlled. Produced as part of the V&A exhibition Plywood: Material of the Modern World (15 July – 12 November 2017) https://www.vam.ac.uk/plywoodSponsored by MADE.COM.

wlLP3Etr1Ns,Discover nail manufacturing process - Nail production line,"- Discover nail manufacturing process- Nail production line In woodworking and construction, a nail is a pin-shaped object of metal (or wood, called a treenail or ""trunnel"") which is used as a fastener, as a peg to hang something, or sometimes as a decoration.[1] Generally nails have a sharp point on one end and a flattened head on the other, but headless nails are available. Nails are made in a great variety of forms for specialized purposes. The most common is a wire nail. Other types of nails include pins, tacks, brads, and spikes. Nails are typically driven into the workpiece by a hammer, a pneumatic nail gun, or a small explosive charge or primer. A nail holds materials together by friction in the axial direction and shear strength laterally. The point of the nail is also sometimes bent over or clinched after driving to prevent pulling out.",manufacturing

dRMF9lC0tXs,Additive Manufacturing - Laser Deposition Technology LDT:,"Additive Manufacturing - Laser Deposition Technology (LDT):------------------------------------------------------------------Laser Deposition Technology (LDT) is a process in which metal powder is injected into the focused beam of a high-power laser under tightly controlled atmospheric conditions. The focused laser beam melts the surface of the target material and generates a small molten pool of base material. Powder delivered into this same spot is absorbed into the melt pool, thus generating a deposit that may range from 0.125 to 1 mm thick and 1 to 4 mm wide. The resulting deposits may then be used to build or repair metal parts for a variety of different applications.There are three main areas where LDT can be used in manufacturing processes; it can be used in repair of worn components, especially in any type of mechanical equipment with moving parts. This process is known as Laser Repair Technology (LRT). Also, this technique can be used in the application of cladding materials, which known as Laser Cladding Technology (LCT). LCT is a process that repairs surfaces on parts by first machining down the worn surface and building it back up by depositing cladding material in thin layers to restore the worn surface. Finally, this technique can be used in performing near-net-shape freeform builds, which known as Laser Freeform Manufacturing Technology (LFMT). This technique starts with a CAD drawing of a part, from this electronic drawing, a tool path file is built. The laser deposition system then builds the part layer by layer. LFMT can build complex shapes, prototyping and manufacturing some parts in far less time than any other technique.Eng. Rami Khalil",manufacturing

04uKmaKa8DU,Manufacturing Predictions - The future of the manufacturing industry (ISCF - Clean Growth),"What will the future of manufacturing be like?Imagine needing a new part for a household appliance. You could order it, get it made locally and get it delivered to your door within a couple of hours.Advances in 3D Printing and additive manufacturing will reduce waste even more, making it possible to create products and components that we can't make now.Everything will be connected by the Internet of Things to ensure that supply can keep track of changes in demand.Robots will take care of the repetitive, dangerous processes so that people can focus on matters where human interaction is so valuable. So whether you are a manufacturer or a consumer, we are going to see much more manufacturing as part of our everyday lives.Anything, anywhereIn the next 30 years, we will see manufacturing become more and more unbound from the idea of factories as we know them today. It will be freed up to appear in new locations, becoming an empowering force that drives customisation and personalisation of products across multiple sectors. All of this thanks to 3D printing innovation.Fast forward to 2035: Do you see a piece of jewellery you like in a shop window, but it’s not quite the right colour or size? The shop will be able to 3D print you a custom piece in minutes, based precisely on your measurements and preferences. 3D Printing will drive a true paradigm shift for manufacturing, away from the mass production in a distant factory to something that happens right in front of you, creating a bespoke product for the same cost. By 2050 you may even be able to print clothes at home from designs shared online.Subscribe to our YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/user/Innovate...Find out about our other predictions, including healthcare and cities, here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...Click here to find out our essential tips for small businesses: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...",manufacturing

But we can share enough to give you a rare peek behind the curtain.The Paju complex is made up of eight enormous buildings each seemingly larger than an airport terminal that sit on 420 acres. A ninth, called P9, is currently under construction. When completed, it will be the world’s largest OLED manufacturing plant. More than 17,000 people work at Paju, many living in enormous residential complexes on site. We flew on the LG helicopter an hour south to the Gumi facility, where LG assembles OLED and LED televisions. It was especially big: Picture several warehouses fused together. It doesn’t require the clean-room garb we donned for phone assembly. Because technology changes so rapidly, assembly lines are designed to be modular. The Seocho Research & Development facility. It was born in 2009, and over 3000 people work there, giving birth to high-tech ideas from a glimmering pool of silicon and ambition. And as such, it’s one of the super secretive facilities that LG guards closely: Admission to Seocho meant forfeiting cell phones and laptops, signing non-disclosure forms, and so on. Indeed, we were only allowed to record a short video outside of the building.SUBSCRIBE FOR THE LATEST VIDEOShttp://bit.ly/DTYouTubeSubVISIT DIGITAL TRENDS http://www.digitaltrends.com/CHECK OUT OUR LATEST PODCASThttp://www.digitaltrends.com/podcasts/FOLLOW US!https://www.facebook.com/digitaltrendshttps://twitter.com/digitaltrendshttps://www.instagram.com/digitaltrendshttps://plus.google.com/+digitaltrend...",manufacturing

subeIZgLquI,How To Make A T-Shirt From Design To Manufacturing Process,"In this video I show you how to make a t-shirt from the design to manufacturing process. It starts with designing a shirt, pattern making, sewing, cutting and then goes into large production manufacturing. More from Bella Canvas: http://bit.ly/2t9Guo6 When starting a clothing line it's important to know the process, and this video is a great way to learn what it takes to create a t-shirt from scratch. Sign up to the newsletter and receive free downloads to help grow your business + enter to win upcoming giveaways:  http://bit.ly/Apparel-Download The following steps can be applied to make any product, so feel free to jot down notes and reference this section for future use. Step 1: T-Shirt Design The first step to making a t-shirt involves the design sketch. Create a sketch that depicts the angles and details you'd like the final shirt to have. It doesn't have to be super fancy, as long as you can show what you need. Designing a shirt with the end goal in mind helps the pattern maker know what you are going for. Thanks you Torey Lewitz for joining us.Step 2: Pattern MakingOnce the designs are completed, you will consult with a pattern maker to bring your clothing line to life. The pattern maker will take your designs and create “patterns” which are the pieces that will be cut and sewn together. Step 3: Sample CuttingOnce the patterns are completed, they are printing on a plotter that creates the outline for the sample cutter. The person in charge of cutting the sample will follow the guides to ensure the pieces are cut to the right specifications. Castle Notches allow the person in charge of sewing to close the product up right. Step 4: Sewing The T-ShirtAfter the fabric is cut out, it is ready to be sewn. The cut pieces are now the shape of the patterns and multiple sewing machines are used to finish the design. The final outcome is hopefully what you envisioned. But more than likely it won’t be the final fit, so you will repeat the process until you are happy with the size, fit and shape of your apparel line. Step 5: Mass Production CuttingAs soon as the shirt or apparel design you created is approved, the patterns are finalized and sent into the production process. John Chacon Head Of Production walks us through his process. Step 6: Mass Production Sewing Once the pieces are all cut out, they are sent to the sewing factory. The factory is given the cut fabric and the head of production is in charge of making sure everyone knows what their role is. Step 7: Order Fulfillment/ Clothing Line DistributionThe last step in this video is the order fulfillment and distribution of the finished clothing. As a clothing business you also have to think about how you will provide quicker shipping, handle returns and manage employees. Randy Pinter Head of Warehouse Distribution drops the knowledge on what it takes to run this facility.

kusAX4Th4N8,Manufacturing Consent: Thought Control in a Democratic Society - Noam Chomsky,"Walter Lippmann (23 September 1889 -- 14 December 1974) was an American public intellectual, writer, reporter, and political commentator famous for being among the first to introduce the concept of Cold War. More Chomsky: https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=U...Lippmann was twice awarded (1958 and 1962) a Pulitzer Prize for his syndicated newspaper column, ""Today and Tomorrow"".Edward Louis Bernays (November 22, 1891 -- March 9, 1995), was an Austrian-American pioneer in the field of public relations and propaganda, referred to in his obituary as ""the father of public relations."" He combined the ideas of Gustave Le Bon and Wilfred Trotter on crowd psychology with the psychoanalytical ideas of his uncle, Sigmund Freud.He felt this manipulation was necessary in society, which he regarded as irrational and dangerous as a result of the 'herd instinct' that Trotter had described. Adam Curtis's award-winning 2002 documentary for the BBC, The Century of the Self, pinpoints Bernays as the originator of modern public relations, and Bernays was named one of the 100 most influential Americans of the 20th century by Life magazine.Harold Dwight Lasswell (February 13, 1902 — December 18, 1978) was a leading American political scientist and communications theorist. He was a member of the Chicago school of sociology and was a professor at Yale University in law. He was a President of the American Political Science Association (APSA) and World Academy of Art and Science (WAAS). According to a biographical memorial written by Gabriel Almond at the time of Lasswell's death and published by the National Academies of Sciences in 1987, Lasswell ""ranked among the half dozen creative innovators in the social sciences in the twentieth century."" At the time, Almond asserted that ""few would question that he was the most original and productive political scientist of his time."" Areas of research in which Lasswell worked included the importance of personality, social structure, and culture in the explanation of political phenomena. He was noted to be ahead of his time in employing a variety of methodological approaches that later became standards across a variety of intellectual traditions including interviewing techniques, content analysis, para-experimental techniques, and statistical measurement.The Committee on Public Information, also known as the CPI or the Creel Committee, was an independent agency of the government of the United States created to influence U.S. public opinion regarding American participation in World War I. Over just 28 months, from April 13, 1917, to August 21, 1919, it used every medium available to create enthusiasm for the war effort and enlist public support against foreign attempts to undercut America's war aims.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committe...",manufacturing

HjnCNMvPha8,Why American Manufacturing Matters,"Footage Courtesy of Death By China on YouTubehttp://crouchingtiger.net While brave American soldiers and sailors and flyers at the front lines ultimately won World War II, they had at their backs heartland factories that could churn out tanks and planes and ships at rates far greater than the enemy could destroy them – definitive proof of the winning ways of what the great Prussian strategist Karl von Clausewitz once aptly referred to as “war by algebra.”  Today, however, many of those heartland factories that won World War II for America have been shuttered and moved to cities with names like Chengdu, Chongqing, and Shenzhen.  And here’s the obvious strategic problem:If World War III does indeed arrive – triggered by some trigger-happy PLA captain in the South China Sea or a nuclear strike by Pyongyang on Seoul or America coming to Japan’s defense over some “rocks in the sea” – the United States will no longer have mass on its side.",manufacturing

Q4AuIFqneUU,Royal Enfield Manufacturing Process Plant - Chennai,"Royal Enfield Manufacturing Process Plant Chennai / Full bullet making process /RE Plant ChannaiBe a Member of my Channel - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk0M...Royal Enfield has begun commercial production at its new manufacturing facility at Vallam Vadagal near Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. Spread over 50 acres, the plant is the bike maker's third manufacturing facility and will manufacture Royal Enfield motorcycles for India and international markets.Construction of the new facility started 15 months back and has been completed in record time. The new facility has been benchmarked to the highest level of quality and productivity. The manufacturing capacity in this facility will enable the company to meet its next level of growth.In the first phase, the state-of-the-art plant kicks off with an installed production capacity of 300,000 motorcycles. In FY2017-18, the combined production capacity from all the three plants is planned to be 8,25,000 units. In FY2016-17, Royal Enfield produced and sold 6,67,135 motorcycles, nearing its installed capacity. The company’s sales have grown at a compounded rate of over 55 percent over the past six years. According to Royal Enfield, its order book continues to be strong and there is a large unmet demand. In FY2017-18, it plans to invest Rs 800 crore, largely towards capacity expansion at Vallam Vadagal, new products and platforms, and setting up of technical centres in Leicester, UK and Chennai, India. This investment will be funded through internal accruals.Recently, Bajaj Auto formed an alliance with Triumph Motorcycles to enter the mid-sized motorcycle space. There are a number of other domestic OEMs also eyeing this segment. The capacity expansion is also part of Royal Enfield’s strategy to prepare itself to face competition.Royal Enfield begins production at new Chennai plantRoyal Enfield Manufacturing Process Plant - ChennaiRoyal Enfield Manufacturing Process Plant - ChennaiRoyal Enfield Manufacturing Process Plant - ChennaiRoyal Enfield Manufacturing Process Plant - ChennaiRoyal Enfield Manufacturing Process Plant - ChennaiRoyal Enfield Manufacturing Process Plant - ChennaiRoyal Enfield Manufacturing Process Plant - ChennaiRoyal Enfield Manufacturing Process Plant - Chennai-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-Please watch: ""Royal Enfield Full Service At HOME - PART 1"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7p6A...-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-",manufacturing

Independently, these savings are compelling, but together, they are game changing and will enable future missions to reach new destinations.  The 2.4 meter tank is a major element of the Composite Cryotank Technologies Demonstration Project‹ a technology that is one of the top nine projects funded by NASA¹s Space Technology Mission Directorate, which is innovating, developing, testing and flying hardware for use in NASA's future missions.",manufacturing

KBn-JEZhoPE,Ancient Warangal Fort -  A Mass Manufacturing Megalithic Factory?,"Instagram................ https://instagram.com/praveenETTwitter...................... https://twitter.com/PraveenMohanETFacebook.............. https://www.facebook.com/praveenmohan...Website.................... https://www.phenomenalplace.comHey guys, today let us take a look at the famous Warangal Fort in India. This is one of the strangest ancient sites, at first look, we can see thousands  and thousands of rocks, cut in various shapes, strewn all over this site. I mean you can literally find any geometric shape you want in this site - this is extraordinary stone work. When you hear the name Warangal Fort, you expect to see a fort or fortifications or crude walls, but here you will find some of the most beautiful carvings, this was definitely not built as a fort. . A fort does not need such beautiful, artistic carvings and complex geometric shapes. Historians also agree that this site is not a fort, but they merely call this a fort, because it is surrounded by fortifications many miles away, but they have no idea what the actual purpose of  this place was. Why do we have so many rocks piled up? And in these piles, we can also find some of the most exotic Hindu Gods lying in the dirt. These statues are priceless and are actually worth millions of dollars. In India, you can see they are just left lying around in dirt. Because we find several idols like this, some have argued that this site was built as a temple, and it was later ruined. Was this site, once an ancient temple? and was it ruined by nature or humans? If you examine the site carefully, you can find something weird. There are at least a dozen different types of rocks. This is Red Stone, this is black basalt, and this is granite. This is bizarre, because if a temple was built with a combination of all these rocks, it will look ugly. All Hindu temples are usually built with the same type of rock, it would be impossible to use so many types of rocks for constructing a single temple. And the entrances to this confirm that this was not a temple.  The entire site is surrounded by 4 entrances which are just incredibly huge, they are each 33 feet tall. There are no walls surrounding it either, this is very unique, a temple does not need such tall entrances and Hindu temples always have an outer wall around them. If this was not a temple and this was not a fort, what was going on here? What was the actual purpose of this site?No one has come up with a solid answer to this question, but after analyzing this place carefully, I can say this entire place was built as a manufacturing site, as a factory for mass manufacturing, megalithic stone objects. Now, what I am saying goes against all the theories of archeologists and historians. They believe that every ancient temple was built by local artisans and stone masons, who cut stone blocks and carved statues on site, within the temple premises. But Warangal Fort shows something extraordinary, it shows that the pillars, statues, and even blocks for walls were built at a completely different location, a mass manufacturing site. This was the purpose of this site. #Search4Truth #AncientTechnology #AncientAliens",manufacturing

Z61Uii5K2j8,Improve Operator Efficiency - Manufacturing,"Measuring and improving operator efficiency of machines and equipment on the shopfloor can have a dramatic effect on manufacturing productivity and output.PlantRun systems can be used to measure, track and analyse individual operator performance and compare the performance of machine operators against time/machine/product etc.. This allows you to identify under performing staff for re-training and to spread the best practices of your most efficient staff thereby improving operator efficiency.Improved Time ManagementOperators starting late, taking extra time during breaks, finishing early and taking longer to restart a machine than they should is a typical scenario in many manufacturing companies.Even if  this is only arriving at the machine 5 minutes late, starting up 5 minutes later, taking an extra 10 minutes over lunchtime and then finishing 10 minutes early it amounts to 30 minutes in an 8 hour shift equivalent to 6.25%. Without continuous monitoring in place this is often much longer. And this is per machine, if you have 20 machines you are losing 10 man hours per shift!Maybe you don't think your staff do this, but until you measure breaks accurately you don't really know. For one PlantRun user a ""ten minute"" break period was reduced from 23 minutes down to 13 minutes upon installation of the system!Increasing Operator ProductivityAn example of increased operator productivity comes from a wire fabrication company producing a wide range of goods including roll containers, stillages, pallet converters, dollies, picking trollies and garment rails.The company employ a core staff of around 100 staff but at peak production times this number can double with low skilled agency staff. The productivity of temporary staff is variable and with a relatively labour intensive production process maximising operator output is vital. All the fabrication machinery is monitored for machine utilization efficiency.Operators log on to the system at shift start up and the system monitors run time, stop time and reasons for stoppage. By analysing downtime stoppages problems such as extended operator breaks are identified and addressed.System reports make it easy to identify operators with poor productivity performance for training or replacement.  A typical reported improvement in operator productivity boosted output per shift from 80 to 94 units, an increase of 17.5%.Improved MotivationStaff motivation can be improved in two ways.Firstly, the data collected by the system can be used to keep staff informed of their performance against target production rates either using the keypad terminals or large shopfloor displays.  Goal setting and competition between work groups or cells can significantly improve motivation and output.Secondly, the awareness that production is being monitored and the understanding that computers can't lie often have a refreshing effect on staff behavioural patterns and bad practices that may have been formed over time. In some cases dramatic improvements in productivity have been recorded before systems have been fully installed, simply from improving operator efficiency.",manufacturing

zho-EHvTqgg,Additive manufacturing simulation with HAAS VF3-HMT head,"VERICUT’s Additive module simulates both additive and traditional machining (milling or turning) capabilities of new hybrid CNC machines using the same NC code that controls the machine. The Additive module provides CNC machine simulation for accurate laser cladding and material deposition. VERICUT reads the laser parameters, controls laser wattage, flow of carrier gas, and metallic powder specific to each job/material type. VERICUT detects collisions between the machine and additive part with its collision checking extended to cover additive parts as they are being built, and expensive hybrid machine laser equipment. This provides the ability to gauge potential problems beforehand. With droplet technology, VERICUT’s additive model is much more than just deposited material. Each bead contains valuable history information about how it got there. This saves time investigating errors, voids, or misplaced material, since the source of the problem is revealed with just one-click. The Additive module offers superior simulation of material deposition that is easily distinguished from cut stock. Therefore, having the ability to clearly see where each bead of material is placed in a step-by-step process is essential for successful Additive Manufacturing. The verification process of VERICUT accurately checks for errors on all 5-axis milling, turning, and additive laser sintering processes no matter how complex the machining operation. Simulation is powered by the same post-processed NC code used to drive the CNC machine, which enables the user to ensure additive functions are within proper ranges. VERICUT makes it simple to alternate from additive, to cutting, and back to additive in any sequence.",manufacturing

B8Pkp7OhwPg,"Lean Manufacturing: Cycle Time Analysis, Variance Tracking & Eliminating Work Stoppages","http://www.driveyoursuccess.com The following video is a summary of a project that was run for a small manufacturer were we analyzed their production throughput, performed cycle time analysis and review while also tracking the variances in those cycle times. We use three methods to calculate average in cycle time analysis for this and other projects. These three are the mean, the mode and the median.The video explains how to calculate manufacturing cycle time averages in these three aforementioned ways. The mean is the one we always associate as average. This simply involves taking all the cycle times in a given sample portion and dividing it by the number of operations or cycle times captured.The next method of the mode manufacturing cycle time which is simply the cycle time that appears most frequently during the sample portion. Ultimately, the mode is often the one where the work stoppages and downtime are not a factor. As such, it's often the best benchmark for cycle time analysis.Finally, the median involves re-configuring all the times from lowest to highest and using the following calculation to identify the average time: Median { ( N + 1 ) / 2 } where N is the number of operations. In this case, it's 10 +1 = 11 divided by 2 which is 5.5. Therefore, we isolate the cycle time in-between the 5th and 6th time. Finally, all of these cycle times are placed on a graph in order to identify the variances in cycle times and high and low points. The idea is to isolate the root causes of high and low cycle times while putting a plan in motion to eliminate causes of work stoppages.

Clay which provides aluminium and silica.Cement is manufactured by two methods they are. Wet process. Dry process. Now let us discuss wet process and dry process detailed.WET PROCESS:In the wet process, first the clay is purified by washing in a wash mill.The lime stone is crushed into small particles and mixed with purified clay in proper proportions to get raw slurry.DRY PROCESS: In the dry process the raw materials are mixed in proper proportions.The mixture is dried, pulverized (Crushed into fine particles) and made uniform. The resulting powder is called ""raw material"".The raw slurry or raw meal, obtained by one of wet or dry process called charge. Charge is introduced into a rotary Kiln.The rotary kiln consists of a steel cylinder about 150meters long and 4meter diameter and rotates 30 to 60 turns per hour.At one end of the cylinder a screw conveyer is arranged which slowly allows the charge into the cylinder.The other end of the cylinder, a burneris arranged coal or burning oil is burnt at this end.The charge entering the cylinder slowly moves towards the hot end.At the burning end of the kiln, the temperature is around 1700 to 1900degrees centigrade, at this end some chemical reactions takes place between calcium oxide and aluminium silicates.Mixture of calcium silicates and calcium aluminates is formed.The resultant product consists of gray hard balls called clinker cement.Clinker cement is cooled, ground to fine powder and mixed with 2 to 3 percent of gypsum.",manufacturing

pf-tQYcZGM4,📺 Noam Chomsky's Manufacturing Consent revisited | The Listening Post,"There is an exquisite and oft-quoted moment in an interview between BBC journalist Andrew Marr and Noam Chomsky in which Marr asks: ""How can you know that I'm self-censoring?"".""I'm not saying you're self censoring. I'm sure you believe everything you're saying. But what I'm saying is that if you believed something different, you wouldn't be sitting where you're sitting.""Wry as ever, Chomsky exposed the slightly delusional pretensions of the journalistic establishment - and not far behind, the complicities of the media industry with political power.Harsh? Perhaps. True? All too often.For many of us who work at The Listening Post, Chomsky's ideas on the media in Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media have provided us with a guide, full of cautionary tales and ideas that are still controversial to this day.The book was published in 1988 - a year before the end of the Cold War when it was announced that western liberal democracy had triumphed, heralding the end of ideology, authoritarianism, and propaganda.In the past 30 years, we have seen the mass communications industry multiply, providing an illusion of choice, echoing the rhetorics of freedom - of press, of expression - but not necessarily yielding the pluralism liberal democracies had promised.In that way, the book continues to resonate.But like all revered texts, Manufacturing Consent also calls upon us as active readers, journalists, citizens to interrogate its premises. Does the book's denunciatory tone risk overstate the power of the media establishment? Does it underestimate the critical faculties of the public? Is the media so homogenous an entity that power can be wielded top-down? Where are the lapses, the blind spots? Where do journalists find pockets of power that serve to disrupt?We spoke to three journalists who have their careers being disruptive and asked them about the ideas that had influenced them in Chomsky and Herman's book: Matt Taibbi, whose reporting for Rolling Stone has provided one of the most critical accounts of US political history in recent years; Indian editor-in-chief Aman Sethi who questions the premises of Chomsky's book and Amira Hass, the Haaretz correspondent for the Occupied Territories.The first thing we asked Hass was what she thought about Chomsky's statement: ""the general population doesn't know what's happening, and it doesn't even know that it doesn't know"".""This is a very humanist and optimistic statement,"" she responded. ""The belief that when people are informed they may act, things may change. In Hebrew, the words knowledge and awareness are all made of the same root. Yedda and Mudaoot. And so awareness is connected to Mudaoot in Hebrew. And this is how I started working in Gaza, aware that the Israeli public knows nothing about the occupation and what it means. But the people do not pick up this information. They have access to it but they choose not to access it.""Hass has been covering Palestine for the best part of 30 years - in that time, sources of information have multiplied, but public outrage?""Today we have so much access to information in other ways that we are on a collision with the fact that people are not interested in what does not serve immediately their interest,"" she said, with resignation, ""and this is a very sad realisation.""Aman Sethi put it like this:""It's easy to say that people believe what they believe because their consent has been manufactured. But what if people know exactly what's going on and still believe what they believe, right? Then that's terrifying.""More from The Listening Post on:YouTube - http://aje.io/listeningpostYTFacebook - http://facebook.com/AJListeningPostTwitter - http://twitter.com/AJListeningPostWebsite - http://aljazeera.com/listeningpost- Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe - Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish - Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera - Check our website: https://www.aljazeera.com/",manufacturing

Pushing is a manufacturing method that emphasizes storing a lot of products in order to have them ready to push to customers at a moment's notice. This results in high carrying costs and potentially more unusable inventory as it passes its expiration date.Pulling is more efficient than pushing. It emphasizes JIT (Just In Time) shipping and only ordering parts and products when customer orders come in. This cuts down on carrying costs and leads to a more streamlined operation. It is slower than the push method, so there is a trade-off.Fishbowl's Whiteboard Wednesday videos break down important inventory management topics in a couple of minutes.

ZK9cJt3C_I8,What is Manufacturing Execution System (MES)?,"Let’s tune as our President and CEO Scott Whitlock explains how MES is all about flows within manufacturing – planning flows, execution flows and monitoring flows.Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) are known by many names: data collection solutions, shop floor execution systems, and manufacturing operations management (MOM).Manufacturing Execution Systems collect multiple plants’ production information, and integrate easily with equipment, controllers and enterprise business applications. Although MES solutions are used to operate as a self-contained system, they are increasingly being integrated with enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. The result is complete visibility, control and manufacturing optimization – from order placing, production inception, and process control to product output.------Flexware Innovation, Inc. began in 1996 with a passion for helping manufacturers harness the power of MES and realize the strategic benefits of improved yields, lower operating costs and overall leaner manufacturing. And it’s still a passion for our FlexDogs today, as we help manufacturers across the U.S. implement MES within their operations. It’s one of the things we love most. Well that, and IoT technology within the manufacturing arena, but that’s a blog for another day.------To learn more about Flexware Innovation and how they help manufacturer's with their MES systems, please visit http://www.flexwareinnovation.com/To download our eBook ""5 Risks of Sticking with a Legacy MES"", visit http://flexwareinnovation.com/ebook/",manufacturing

Max and Stacy meet with photographer, Peter Duke, who has been branded ‘alt-right’ by the mainstream media. They ask him about the power of memes to alter the course of history. Did a racist cartoon frog emerging from the darkest recesses of online chat boards really help defeat ‘the most qualified’ presidential candidate in US history?Max and Stacy also talk to a Hollywood screenwriter about which feature film characters best capture the essence of modern America, and about the real violence that is part of our DNA, from slavery to genocide of the native population. Max and Stacy also find Donald Trump’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, because – of course – it is Hollywood itself that created the myth that is the straight-talking, successful billionaire real-estate developer and builder for whom many voted to become president of the United States of America.

We can divide the process into 4 stages: material & pigment preparation, injection mold set up, molding parameters adjustment, molding production run.After mold setting up to injection machine, we will start cleaning off the barrel. It is a time-consuming job sometimes. We will have to put clean material to the barrel so that the barrel to be free of the previous material in last injection molding thoroughly.When start adjusting the molding parameter, we will start some safer molding parameter. The process normally will start from about 50% of a full molded part, then 80%, then 95-98%, final adjusting external cosmetic and other specified tolerance if there is any special requirement.For production tool, we would suggest having the production window as large as possible. So that it will be more steady quality during molding production. The tool building lead time will be longer, while the cost will be higher.While for rapid tooling, and low-volume injection molding, the tooling structure would be simplified. Then molding parameters adjustment would be more difficult. And also, during low-volume production, the production situation would not be as steady, or efficiency as a production tool.In low-volume production, unit prices of adjusting molding parameters would be considered in rapid tooling, low volume production and a small quantity of on-demand manufacturing. While at high volume production, molding parameters adjustment normally is not considered into unit prices.Danke Mold specialized in medium-low volume injection molding, quick-turn injection molding.

ncli94xodm8,Module 3: Make It: Manufacturing and Operations - ASU's W. P. Carey School,"Module 3  Make It: Manufacturing and OperationsPart 3 of 12  Manufacturing is a key supply chain function, but one that many students find a bit intimidating.  This episode tries to demystify manufacturing by looking at manufacturing plants that are probably just down the street.  What is the tie between research and development, product design, manufacturing, and procurement?  What about outsourcing manufacturing?  What do modern operations and manufacturing managers need to consider?This is the 3rd installment in Arizona State University's twelve-part introduction to supply chain management video series developed by Eddie Davila, Jeff Hough, Randy Cates, Dawn Feldman, Dan Ichikawa, Ian Schmoel, and Matt Hardy.  ASU, the W. P. Carey School of Business, and the Supply Chain Management Department are proud and happy to share this video series with supply chain management departments, supply chain instructors, career specialists in high schools and universities, as well as industry leaders in an effort to inspire a new generation of supply chain management professionals across the country and around the world.

Kslh8XUphJo,IACMI Wind Blade Prototype (Composites Manufacturing Innovation),"Knoxville, TN, January 31, 2017— The Institute for Advanced Composites Manufacturing Innovation (IACMI) unveiled an advanced technology prototype wind blade during the Winter IACMI members meeting February 1-2 in Denver, Colorado. The nine- meter long blade was fabricated at IACMI’s Wind Technology Area in the Denver, Colorado area. Commercialization of the wind blade prototype created could speed production times, reduce manufacture cost, and provide stronger, more energy-efficient blades for the United States.A large team of eleven industrial partners, including Arkema Inc., Johns Manville, TPI Composites Inc., Huntsman Polyurethanes, Strongwell, DowAksa USA, Chomarat North America, Composites One, SikaAxson, Creative Foam and Chem-Trend, provided materials and on site fabrication support for blade component manufacturing and assembly. Pultruded spar caps were fabricated at Strongwell in Bristol, Virginia and shipped to Colorado for incorporation into the blade shells. The project was led by IACMI’s Wind Technology Area, based in the Denver, Colorado area , with support from IACMI Headquarters, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Manufacturing Office, and the Advanced Industries Program administered by the Colorado Office of Economic Trade and Development (OEDIT).The prototype blade is based on an existing design from previous work conducted by the DOE, representing a small-scale version of a utility-scale multi-megawatt blade. The new blade, molded on tooling supplied by TPI Composites, Inc., features innovations such as impact resistant components, continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastic parts and exterior shell components produced with less than half the normal CO2 emissions commonly emitted in wind blade manufacture.",manufacturing

The company has invested a double digit million amount to set up the motor production facility. Approximately 100 people are employed in this new area at present.For the production of electric motors, Audi Hungaria installed the innovative production equipment and islands within just one year. The departments for the development of electric motors and for production planning cooperated closely with the prototype manufacturing/ production technology center in Győr to develop the required expertise. The current production capacity is for approximately 400 electric axle motors each day and can be gradually increased. At present, about 100 people are employed in this new area, to be increased to more than 130 by the end of the year. Production is with one‑shift operation, but will soon change to three shifts.The electric motor from Győr offers numerous new features. With the stator – one of the core components of the motor – the aim is to insert as much of the thin enameled copper wire as possible into the casing: the tighter the winding, the more efficient the power delivery. A new winding and inserting center at Audi Hungaria makes it possible to wind the optimal amount of enameled copper wire particularly compactly and then insert it into the casing. The electric axle consists of other large components such as the power electronics, which are located in their own housing, the gearing and two flange shafts that transmit the power to the wheels. The employees produce two electric axle drive systems for each Audi e-tron, as both the front and rear axles are driven – in good quattro tradition.The production equipment, the robots and the bolting and measuring station are set out in fixed positions but are not linked together by a linear band. Instead, the employees produce the drive systems according to a modular method in production islands. Despite a predefined assembly sequence, the modular system allows branched paths and more free scope in the production process. Driverless vehicles, controlled by an intelligent IT system, transport the parts to the workstations.In parallel to the production facility, Audi Hungaria has installed three test benches for electric motors in the engine/motor development department, for testing and continuous load operation. The employees have undergone further training to become electrical experts in the production technology center for electric motors.Audi Hungaria produced 1,965,165 engines last year, making the company one of the world’s largest engine producers. At the plant in Győr, six different gasoline engines and three different diesel engines were produced in 2017 with power output ranging from 63 kilowatts (86 horsepower) to 470 kW (639 hp). Approximately 6,000 employees produce about 9,000 engines each day for 32 production plants of the Volkswagen Group.",manufacturing

J4qwK1KgL_s,Philippines: Cebu Province: Illegal Gun-Manufacturing Centre - 1997,"Cebu province in the Philippines is known for its beautiful beaches and resorts.But Cebu is known to Filipinos for its illegal gun-manufacturing centred in the city of  Danao.Recently, the government has approved licences for two gun manufacturing companies  in Danao.But some remain in operation even without a permit, and this is likely to continue.UPSOUND: (Sound of rapid gunfire from Uzi-gram)Byron Garcia is testing what he calls an ""uzi-gram"".It's one of the products being manufactured by the Danao Arms Manufacturing  Corporation, or Damcor - the first licensed gun manufacturer in Danao City.The city of Danao, in the Philippine central island of Cebu, has always been notorious  as the centre of illegal gun manufacturing.Here, thousands of residents have been involved for decades in what is virtually  considered a cottage industry, making home-made guns, popularly known as ""paltik"".By establishing Damcor, Garcia has legalised gun manufacturing in Danao. Damcor specialises on the 38-revolver, and is also producing machine pistols and  shotguns mainly to supply the country's security agencies.Garcia has invested more than 40 (m) million pesos in Damcor, some of which were  spent on machines with state of the art  technology to produce some of the gun parts.But most of the work is left for the 70 workers that Garcia has employed since his  company opened last year.Most of their experience is based on what they've been clandestinely doing in their  backyard for years.30-year old Lito Gonzales was into illegal gun making for ten years before he decided to  work for Damcor.  Here, he earns about 600-dollars a month, and is free from the anxiety of being arrested  by the authorities.SOUNDBITE: (Tagalog) ""Now, we're okay here, because we don't need to worry about being arrested today or  tomorrow, that the police will arrest us because it's illegal to do guns outside. No  more.""SUPER CAPTION:  Lito Gonzales, worker Danao Arms Manufacturing CorporationBut despite the entry of Damcor and another licensed gun company, Garcia believes  that the illegal gun- manufacturing industry in Danao will continue to flourish, mainly  because of the lack of political will to remove it.SOUNDBITE:  (English) ""Maybe it will change a bit. But it cannot totally eradicate the illegal business here.""SUPER CAPTION:  Byron Garcia, President Danao Arms Manufacturing CorporationAnd for most of the illegal gun makers in this city, making the ""paltik"" in their  backyards will surely be a hard habit to break.For 20-year-old Julius Capuyan, it's the only job he's known since he was 13 years old.SOUNDBITE:  (Tagalog) ""There's no other way of life for us here. We'd rather live this way, illegally making guns.SUPER CAPTION:  Julius CapuyanMost of the people in Danao have relied on this illegal industry as their livelihood for  decades making the government's job of curbing the unlicensed gun-manufacturing  operations a difficult task.You can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/you...

rEfdO4p4SFc,Additive Manufacturing - Direct Metal Laser Sintering DMLS Technology,"Additive Manufacturing - Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) Technology:--------------------------------------------------------------------------Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) was developed jointly by Rapid Product Innovations (RPI) and EOS GmbH, starting in 1994, as the first commercial rapid prototyping method to produce metal parts in a single process. With DMLS, metal powder (20 micron diameter), free of binder or fluxing agent, is completely melted by the scanning of a high power laser beam to build the part with properties of the original material. Eliminating the polymer binder avoids the burn-off and infiltration steps, and produces a 95% dense steel part compared to roughly 70% density with Selective Laser Sintering (SLS). An additional benefit of the DMLS process compared to SLS is higher detail resolution due to the use of thinner layers, enabled by a smaller powder diameter. This capability allows for more intricate part shapes. Material options that are currently offered include alloy steel, stainless steel, aluminum, bronze, cobalt-chrome, and titanium.Eng.

L3CkzQQFZXs,Additive Manufacturing - LASERTEC 65 3D,"The unique combination of laser deposition welding with a powder nozzle and milling on the LASERTEC 65 3D, is an innovative generative machining method. It allows a faster production of complex geometries and individual 3D-parts. Especially large components up to Ø 500 mm can be produced cost-effectively with this hybrid solution. The flexible changeover between laser and milling operations enables the direct machining of areas that can no longer be reached later on the finished part. The laser process uses a metal powder feed, which allows the additive manufacture of parts without a processing chamber nor the need for a supporting structures. The additive process is up to 10 times faster than the generation in a powder bed. DMG MORI is offering the complete process chain, starting with the NC-programming in the hybrid CAD / CAM system, via the usage of proven technology parameters coming from a material data base, through to machining operations, process monitoring and documentation.",manufacturing

jAInt7hIZlU,The Making of a Steinway - A Steinway & Sons Factory Tour Narrated by John Steinway,"The making of a Steinway piano is a time-honored process involving the hands of many skilled craftspeople over the course of almost a full year. Steinway & Sons pianos are built in just two factories worldwide - one in Astoria, NY and one in Hamburg, Germany. Both factories have been building pianos for well over a century, and although Steinway has always been at the cutting edge in utilizing and perfecting the latest technology where it could make the piano better, we have found that certain things are simply better when done by skilled craftspeople than by a machine. For that reason, many parts of the process in building a Steinway have remained essentially unchanged for generations. So much so, that we were able to take decades-old audio from a narrated factory tour by the late John H. Steinway (great-grandson of Henry E. Steinway, who founded our great company in 1853) and use it as the narration for footage shot at the Steinway NY factory in 2011 by Ben Niles, producer of the documentary film ""Note by Note"" (http://www.notebynotethemovie.com). We hope you enjoy this look inside the Steinway New York factory, narrated in detail by the late, great John Steinway.To learn more about Steinway & Sons, visit http://www.steinway.com.Music from Bach on a Steinway, Steinway & Sons Label 30001, Jeffrey Biegel, Pianist.

tTWIIhKI8cA,How to Design and Manufacture a Product,"It can be quite a challenge to find a manufacturer -- one you like working with and whose factory produces a quality product at a fair price. Here are some tips on how to navigate through the process of finding one, as well as how to optimize your relationship with your manufacturer so that you -- and your customers -- are happy. For more infor visit: http://www.focuspdm.com/Step 1: Creating a PrototypeCreating a working prototype or finding someone who can do it for you is the first step in the manufacturing process. During my early days, I was able to sew most of my prototypes. But as my product, Planecomfort, was refined and the components used and the skills necessary to create the product I envisioned moved beyond my sewing expertise, I knew I needed help. Searching online, I found a wonderful yet small cut-and-sew business in northern California called Left in Stitches.This relationship proved valuable to me in a number of ways. They not only helped refine my original prototype, but they offered many suggestions and ideas for making the product easier to manufacture. Many of these smaller domestic companies offer prototyping services that are invaluable to new entrepreneurs.Once you have a prototype, there is quality and design testing and tweaking. At each stage of development, and every time I received the newer version of my product, I washed, dried, pulled, stretched, zipped, unzipped, and put my product through the proverbial ""ringer."" Making sure your product will exceed your customers' expectations is a sure way to keep them coming back and referring your product to others.Ideally, you want to have a dozen or so finished prototypes. Manufacturers will want one or two samples sent to them as a reference to compare to the finished product their factory is making.I thought I would be able to use Left in Stitches for the long term, but due to logistical reasons and production costs, I had to find an overseas manufacturer. Moving your manufacturing operations overseas means you want large quantities (usually thousands) of the item you are producing. If you want hundreds of something, you may be better off working with a domestic manufacturer.Step 2: Finding a ManufacturerI located my overseas manufacturers through referrals, which provided me with an immediate level of comfort and confidence with these factories. One referral came from a fabric manufacturer. Most fabric manufacturers have relationships with product manufacturers.Another factory was referred to me by a marketing services company. This company manufactures both soft and hard goods and was happy to provide their contact with another business opportunity. Call domestic manufacturers and inquire about their overseas connections. Ask everyone you know if they know someone who manufactures the type of products you are creating. Search online for companies with products similar to yours and call them. Who do they use? How did they get started? My experience is that most people will want to help you.I found it was best to work with at least two different companies when trying to decide who will win your business. Who is easiest to work with? Who meets (or beats) your expectations? Is one more knowledgeable than the other? Having a comparison is essential to ensure you are getting a quality product at a fair price.There are two common ways you can deal with overseas manufacturing. You can find a broker or agent in the U.S. that represents the factory, or deal with a factory directly.Once you have determined who you might like to work with, you must check references on your contact and the factory. Some of the important questions to ask:Was the product made to specifications?What percentage of the shipment was defective?If there was a problem with the shipment, did the factory make restitution?Were deadlines met? If not, what did the factory offer to make amends?Is what was promised delivered?How is the quality of goods they produce?How long have you worked with this person and factory?How many orders have you placed?Is your contact easy to work with?Is he/she responsive to calls and emails?What type of projects does the factory excel in producing? Soft goods, hard goods?What types of companies do they normally work with?Who is responsible for landing the goods in the U.S.?Text by Ann Merlini, founder of Pac'n Nap, LLC.For more information on How to Design and Manufacture a Product visit: http://www.focuspdm.com/",manufacturing

And keep your eye out for the test rider who hits the water feature with a little bit too much gusto!The Rover company began to develop and produced the Rover Imperial motorcycle in November 1902. This was a 3.5hp diamond-framed motorcycle with the engine in the centre and 'springer' front forks, an improvement ahead of its time. The first Rover motorcycle had innovative features such as a spray carburettor, a bottom-bracket engine, and mechanically operated valves. Featuring a strong frame with double front down tubes and a good quality finish, over a thousand Rover motorcycles were sold in 1904.Check us out on facebook: http://bit.ly/2eOUnEkFollow us on Twitter: http://bit.ly/2eULPcZLike us on Instagram: http://bit.ly/2eMJ50z",manufacturing

China has lost its position as the go-to place to invest.Kim Min-ji reports.Japanese watch-maker Citizen recently shut down its factory in Guangzhou.More than one-thousand employees are up in arms after being laid off,... but the company says it′s part of its restructuring plans.Citizen isn′t the only one.U.S. software giant Microsoft has also shut down its Nokia factory in Guangzhou,... and plans to open a new factory in Vietnam.And with the Beijing factory also expected to close,... some 9-thousand employees are expected to lose their jobs.Industry watchers estimate more than 100 large factories, including ones run by Sharp and Panasonic, were shut down before the Chinese New Year in the city of Dongguan  one of the country′s main manufacturing hubs.But what has triggered the mass exodus?Experts say rising labor and land costs.Such factors no longer make China a profitable investment.What′s more is that the world′s second largest economy is not expanding as fast as it used to.Another factor is that countries in Southeast Asia, such as India and Vietnam,... are stepping up efforts to lure foreign companies.The U.S., Japan and Europe are also offering incentives, such as tax cuts and investment support, to encourage home-grown companies to come back.The trend has raised concerns that China′s manufacturing industry,... once driven by cheap labor,... is heading for a crisis.The official Purchasing Managers′ Index stood at 49-point-8,... falling below 50 for the first time in more than two years,.... signalling a contraction.Kim Min-ji, Arirang News.",manufacturing

Visit http://www.freshersworld.com?src=Youtube  for detailed Career information,Job Opportunities,Higher Education details of PRODUCTION ENGINEERING.Just like the name suggests, production engineering is mostly about the study of products and the various processes of its manufacture. Most production engineers are assigned with the task of seeing how products and commodities are exactly fabricated, the machines which are going to be used to create the product and what is the safest and most efficient procedure to get it done. The products could be almost anything, from something as simple and basic as a newspaper to plastic bottles, cans and IPods. Sometimes production engineers are also made to increase the transfer of hydrocarbons from oil into the process of production. Whenever there is some kind of reproduction or creation of a product involved, there is a higher possibility of finding a production engineer close by.So if you are planning to become a production engineer; you must be wondering where your location of work will be. The answer is quite simple; it could be almost anywhere. This depends upon the kind of production you are involved in. If it is oil or gas that you are keen on working with, then you’ll be in some big energy company trying to help the process and boosting cost efficiency. If consumer goods is what interests you the best, then you could be working for one of the biggest supermarkets or malls of the city. All of this does sound fun but there is a lot of effort that needs to be put in before you become a successful production engineer. You have to have proper understanding of scientific applications and must be good at math too. Not just that, you have to be up to date when it comes to new technological developments. Apart from that, you must know how to design, to come up with proper and quality techniques for the system, select the right kind of knowledge and application in order to revamp the functionality of the product and to create and implement different processes and services. In order to start your career in this field, you must finish your 12th standard exam in science subjects such as physics, chemistry and biology. Once that is done with, apply to engineering colleges that have production engineering as an undergraduate course. Here are some of the top colleges in India that have production engineering as a major course• AISSMS College of Engineering• Al Azhar College of Engineering and Technology• Anand Engineering College• Birla Institute of Technology• Chouksey Engineering College• D. Y Patil College of Engineering and Technology• Government College of Engineering, Pune• Haldia Institute of TechnologyEach of these institutions provide you with a degree in production engineering.

A production engineer typically has a wide knowledge of engineering practices and is aware of the management challenges related to production. The goal is to accomplish the production process in the smoothest, most-judicious and most-economic way.Production Engineering encompasses the application of castings,machining processing, joining processes, metal cutting & tool design, metrology, machine tools, machining systems, automation, jigs and fixtures, die and mould design, material science, design of automobile parts, and machine designing and manufacturing. Production engineering also overlaps substantially with manufacturing engineering and industrial engineering.In industry, once the design is realized, production engineering concepts regarding work-study, ergonomics, operation research, manufacturing management, materials management, production planning, etc., play important roles in efficient production processes. These deal with integrated design and efficient planning of the entire manufacturing system, which is becoming increasingly complex with the emergence of sophisticated production methods and control systems.",manufacturing

wH1NUINm4HY,🚘 Car industry: What's the real cost of going electric? | Counting the Cost (Full),"Back in 1888, the electric car was all the rage. But the discovery of large petroleum reserves worldwide and the combustion engine quickly killed it off.Electrification was very much the theme at this year's Geneva Motor Show, but consumers are yet to be convinced. Of the 80 million cars expected to be sold this year, just two million will be electric. However, that's not stopping the big carmakers from making the switch.So what is the future of the automotive industry? What will it take to go electric? And what will be the real cost of it?Economics editor Abid Ali caught up with Linda Jackson, the CEO of Citroen, at the Geneva Motor Show. He began by asking her if electric cars - which take fewer people to assemble - catch on, then what will that mean for jobs.""I don't know whether it's the question of whether it'll take less people to make the car, it's about how many manufacturers will be able to afford to make the cars and how many of our customers will be able to buy our cars because electric cars do mean that potentially that'll be an increase in price. So there's very many factors playing in effect in terms of what the future is for the automotive industry."" China has the lead. Clearly, every manufacturer is trying to find ways to support the supply of batteries in the future because that's absolutely fundamental.Linda Jackson, CEO, CitroenAccording to Jackson, an important consideration is ""the infrastructure that we need to be able to run them and move about in our electric cars, so that's another factor that'll impact our society"".""Customers aren't reluctant to buy it, but they're keen on making sure that they're able to use their cars, charge their cars, to be able to charge them while they're on the move - and that's something that hasn't really been considered, generally. Apart from that, everything will be able for customers but we have to realise that the cost of the batteries, etc will mean there's increment for having an electric car, and I'm not sure all customers realise that there will be an increment.""In terms of the availability of batteries, ""China has the lead. Clearly, every manufacturer is trying to find ways to support the supply of batteries in the future because that's absolutely fundamental ... but China is in a very strong position and in terms of their own market, is moving very quickly towards electric and wanting to encourage electric, obviously on the back of the fact that they're the major battery supplier,"" says Jackson.""Clearly it's a major concern and question for all manufacturers to be able to find solutions and ensure that we have the continued supply of batteries in the future.""Also on this episode of Counting the Cost:Silatech: Five million young people will be entering the job market every year for the next five years in the Middle East. One organisation, Silatech is leading efforts to connect young men and women with jobs. Counting the Cost spoke with the founder and chairwoman of Silatech, Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, on her new efforts in job creation.Power outages in South Africa: In many parts of the world, reliable electricity supply is still a problem. In South Africa, rolling blackouts are impacting many businesses' ability to operate. State-owned Eskom is one of the biggest power utilities in the world, but it's technically insolvent, and its crisis is putting livelihoods at risk. Malcolm Webb reports from Johannesburg.Huawei: Huawei Technologies, China's telecommunications giant, said that it filed a lawsuit against the United States for banning government agencies, employees and contractors from using Huawei equipment as the company attempts to fight back against perceptions that it is a tool used for spying by Beijing. Adrian Brown reports from Shenzhen, where Huawei has its headquarters.Portugal Eurotown: British citizens living in the European Union are waiting anxiously to see what decision their government and Parliament in London are about to make over Brexit. Laurence Lee reports from the Spanish town of Ayamonte which sits on the country's southern border with Portugal.More from Counting the Cost on:YouTube - http://aje.io/countingthecostYTWebsite - http://aljazeera.com/countingthecost/- Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe - Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish - Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera - Check our website: https://www.aljazeera.com/",manufacturing

The OECD on Wednesday released its growth outlook for South Korea's economy in 2019,... projecting it to be 2-point-6 percent.It said the cut was mainly due to a slowdown in global trade.The OECD's previous estimate for South Korea last November was 2-point-8 percent.It also said on Wednesday that South Korea's economy will grow 2-point-6 percent in 2020,... down from its previous forecast of 2-point-9 percent.According to the OECD Interim Economic Outlook,... South Korea's continued fiscal easing and low inflation should support demand,... but exports have slowed sharply,... especially to Asian markets.South Korea's outbound shipments slumped by more than 11 percent on-year last month,... the third straight month that exports have contracted.The numbers suggest South Korea might struggle to reach 600 billion dollars in exports for the second straight year in 2019.The OECD's downward revision comes a matter of days after Moody's slashed its growth outlook for the South Korean economy to 2-point-1 percent,... citing a weakening investment cycle,... the deceleration in global trade,... as well as lower demand in China for intermediate products.However, South Korea is not alone.The OECD says the economic prospects are now weaker in nearly all G20 nations than previously anticipated.It attributed the shaky figures to vulnerabilities in China,... the weakening European economy,... combined with a slowdown in trade  and global manufacturing, high policy uncertainty and risks in financial markets.Lee Seung-jae, Arirang News.

vZ4k--syEa4,S. Korea in record fifth day of emergency air pollution measures amid thick blanket of fine dust,"첫 5일 연속 미세먼지 비상조치…제주는 사상 처음, 정부 비상 대책들For days now, most parts of South Korea including the capital Seoul... have been clouded by fine dust.Our Oh Soo-young is out in central Seoul... to update us on the situation. So, Soo-young, the concentration level of the pollutants reached alarming highs... a cause for concern if you're in Korea.That's right, Daniel. It's clear why the public is worried. We're now into the fifth-consecutive day, and record length of time that emergency fine dust reduction measures have been in place.The measures on Tuesday were expanded to twelve out of seventeen major cities and provinces,... which include Seoul, the surrounding Gyeonggi-do Province -- and for the first time ever -- the southern resort Island of Jeju.Local governments are required to take action when ultra-fine dust density is forecast to be ""very bad"",... or when average daily density exceeds 50 micrograms per cubic meter.Measures in Seoul, for instance, include an alternate driving system for civil servants,... restricting vehicles on the road depending on their license plate number.Operations and output at manufacturing facilities and power plants are also restricted.Schoolchildren have been banned from outdoor activities, while a number of flights and ferries in Jeollanam-do Province have been canceled due to the dust and fog.Unfortunately, due to slow and stagnant winds from China, experts say the smog is likely to stay put on Wednesday,... along with emergency measures. The situation remains critical so the government will actually include fine dust in the category of disasters. Would this help effectively tackle the problem, at least in the future, if not immediately?Yes, officials seem to think so. Government sources said Tuesday that they're working to legally classify fine dust as a social disaster.That's expected to help authorities better prepare countermeasures for worsening bouts of air pollution, as well as outlining a criteria for damage assessment.A proposal has apparently been submitted to parliament -- and officials say it will likely be approved quite soon.In the meantime, Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon has urged all related government bodies to ensure they are properly enforcing emergency measures.That's all I have for you right now.Back to you, Daniel.

Ot-acn1whrc,The Coming War On China | History Documentary | Reel Truth History,"The Coming War on China, from award winning journalist John Pilger, reveals what the news doesn’t – that the world’s greatest military power, the United States, and the world’s second economic power, China, both nuclear-armed, may well be on the road to war. Nuclear war is not only imaginable, but planned. The greatest build-up of NATO military forces since the Second World War is under way on the western borders of Russia. On the other side of the world, the rise of China is viewed in Washington as a threat to American dominance. To counter this, President Obama announced a ‘pivot to Asia’, which meant that almost two-thirds of all US naval forces would be transferred to Asia and the Pacific, their weapons aimed at China. A policy which has been taken up by his successor Donald Trump, who during his election campaign said “We can’t continue to allow China to rape our country and that’s what they’re doing”.Filmed on five possible front-lines across Asia and the Pacific over two years, the story is told in chapters that connect a secret and ‘forgotten’ past to the rapacious actions of great power today and to a resistance, of which little is known in the West.To be the first to watch more full length documentaries, subscribe here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb7x...Welcome to Reel Truth History, the home of gripping and powerful documentaries.

OlwsJWkgu7k,Secret History of the Freemasons ~ Full Documentary,"The first president of the United States, George Washington, was a Mason, along with 13 other presidents and numerous Supreme Court Justices. Benjamin Franklin published a book about Freemasonry on his own printing press. Nine signers of the Declaration of Independence were Freemasons, including the man with the biggest signature: Jon Hancock...Suspected throughout their long history of plotting to overtake the world accused of fomenting revolution and reviled as devil worshippers that stole King Solomon's treasure the Freemasons claim they're merely a civic-minded fraternity bound together by harmless rituals. Our high-energy cocktail of dramatic reenactment expert interviews and on-location footage entertains historians Akram Elias Stephen Bullock and Brent Morris to retell the Freemasons' central myth concerning Hiram Abiff mythical builder of Jerusalem's Temple of Solomon. During construction he was killed by three workers who believed his ""secret"" would impart magical powers--representing the three evils against which Freemasons believe they're still struggling: ignorance fanaticism and tyranny. Today the world's 2.5 million Freemasons meet to reenact the ritual of Hiram's murder as the initiation ceremony for the main rank of Master Mason.AMERICA: Is America the creation of the Freemasons? For hundreds of years suspicions of a plot to take over America have swirled around the Freemasons the world's oldest secret society. Freemasons led the Revolution framed the Declaration of Independence and Constitution designed our nation's capitaland in the early years of the Republic grew to unmatched heights of influence and power. The untold story of the Freemasons in America reveals secret codes patterns in the sky murder and a radically new picture of the nation's Founding Fathers.",history

okcfKaC87r4,"American History Textbooks' Lies: Everything Your Teacher Got Wrong - Myths, Education (1995)","Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong is a 1995 book by sociologist James W. Loewen. More about the book: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/074...It critically examines twelve American history textbooks and concludes that textbook authors propagate factually false, Eurocentric, and mythologized views of history. In addition to critiquing the dominant historical themes presented in textbooks, Loewen presents a number of his own historical themes that he says are ignored by traditional history textbooks. A newly revised and updated hardcover edition was released on April 1, 2008. The New Press lists Lies My Teacher Told Me as its top all-time bestseller.In Lies My Teacher Told Me, Loewen criticizes modern American history textbooks for containing incorrect information about people and events such as Christopher Columbus, the lies and inaccuracies in the history books regarding the dealings between the Europeans and the Native Americans, and their often deceptive and inaccurate teachings told about America's commerce in slavery. He further criticizes the texts for a tendency to avoid controversy and for their ""bland"" and simplistic style. He proposes that when American history textbooks elevate American historical figures to the status of heroes, they unintentionally give students the impression that these figures are superhumans who live in the irretrievable past. In other words, the history-as-myth method teaches students that America's greatest days have already passed. Loewen asserts that the muting of past clashes and tragedies makes history boring to students, especially groups excluded from the positive histories.The twelve textbooks Loewen examined for the first edition are:The American Adventure (1975)American Adventures (1987)American History (1982)The American Pageant (1991)The American Tradition (1984)The American Way (1979)The Challenge of Freedom (1990)Discovering American History (1974)Land of Promise (1983)Life and Liberty (1984)Triumph of the American Nation (1986)The United States: A History of the Republic (1991)In the second edition, Loewen added six more books; including a newer edition of The American Pageant:The American Journey (2000)The American Pageant (2006)The Americans (2007)America: Pathways to the Present (2005)A History of the United States (2005)Holt American Nation (2003)Lies my Teacher Told Me is the winner of the 1996 American Book Award,[3] the Oliver Cromwell Cox Award for Distinguished Anti-Racist Scholarship, and the Critics Choice Award of the American Educational Studies Association. Sundown Towns was named one of ten Distinguished Books of 2005 by the Gustavus Myers Foundation.Conservative activist David Horowitz has criticized some of Loewen's assertions for their partiality and inaccuracy, in particular questioning Loewen's claims about the relationship between American Indians and Columbus.Lies My Teacher Told Me is mentioned in the novel Deadline by Chris Crutcher.Lies My Teacher Told Me is mentioned in the liner notes of the Rise Against album, The Sufferer & the Witness.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies_My_...",history

A lot of students may find history boring and would rather focus on the here and now, but sometimes history can be surprising. Bizarre facts and events that we may not have learned about from our high school textbooks. Try as we may, not all information can be stored in a single textbook and history is not an exact science. Sometimes the things that are left out are believed to be ‘too sensitive’ or ‘vulgar’ for young people to hear about and needed to be censored. Other times it’s because it’s not deemed important enough or for convenience sake for different cultures. But these are some of those intriguing events and people that helped shaped the world as we know it today, whether we learned about them in school or not.While many of us would prefer to look to the future, history is a part of everyone’s lives.

BjkU_JR4Cno,England's Forgotten Queen: Lady Jane Grey's Execution | History Documentary | Reel Truth History,"Eight days into her reign as Queen of England, Lady Jane Grey took personal charge of the keys to the Tower of London and even locked her own supporters inside with her. The end was approaching but before her execution, she wrote multiple messages in her prayer book. Historian Helen Castor explores these notes and learns that Lady Jane was actually unflinching and composed until the day she died.In 1553 Tudor England, Wales and Ireland is taken to the brink of a bloody civil war when the dying King Edward VI, son of Henry VIII, leaves the throne, not to his elder sister, Mary, but to his cousin, the Lady Jane Grey.This is a story of intrigue, conspiracy, political manoeuvring and a capital city preparing to be attacked. It is also the story of a young woman, ferociously manipulated by powerful men in the palace, who ends up losing her life as a result.The life of Lady Jane Grey is a tragic narrative. From the moment Edward VI draws Jane into the line of succession, her terrible fate, on the block in the Tower of London, is sealed.Helen Castor is a historian and a medievalist who has studied the She Wolves, those women who held power in various ways throughout the medieval period. Now she sets out to take a close look at the first woman to sit on the English throne, not as consort, but as a reigning Queen. But Helen discovers far more than a story about a Tudor Queen. The story of Jane Grey is surrounded by myth, confusion and propaganda. Images turn out not to be Jane, well known stories turn out to be fake and many of the books disagree on the details. Helen asks why the first woman to be proclaimed Queen of England has attracted so much bending of the truth.Helen undertakes some Tudor detective work and turns back to the primary sources in an attempt to separate the truth from the fiction. She builds the real story of Jane Grey and those dark figures that surrounded her, tracing her world, and the nine days she spent on the throne.To be the first to watch more full length documentaries, subscribe here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb7x...Welcome to ReelTruth.History the home of gripping and powerful documentaries.

History has identified the period following the fall of the Roman Empire with a descent into barbarism – a terrible time when civilisation stopped. Waldemar Januszczak disagrees. In this landmark 4-part series Waldemar argues that the Dark Ages were a time of great artistic achievement, with new ideas and religions provoking new artistic adventures. He embarks on a fascinating trip across Europe, Africa and Asia, visits the world’s most famous collections and discovers hidden artistic gems, all to prove that the Dark Ages were actually an ‘Age of Light'.

Unfortunately it's the only copy I've been able to obtain so far.__________________________Narrated by David AckroydCharles Ponzi became known in the early 1920s as a swindler in North America for his money-making scheme. He promised clients a 50% profit within 45 days, or 100% profit within 90 days, by buying discounted postal reply coupons in other countries and redeeming them at face value in the United States as a form of arbitrage. In reality, Ponzi was paying earlier investors using the investments of later investors. His scheme ran for over a year before it collapsed, costing his ""investors"" $20 million.While this type of fraudulent investment scheme was not originally invented by Ponzi, it became so identified with him that it now is referred to as a Ponzi scheme.____________",history

5w30XgACSAg,The royal weddings that shaped European history,"To Queen Victoria, marriages were about strategic alliances.Correction: At 5:38, the map of post-war Germany is missing eastern Prussia. The borders of Austria-Hungary should also include portions of northern Serbia and southern Poland.Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOThis video was produced in collaboration between Vox and BBCThree.Over the course of her 63-year reign, Queen Victoria strategically planned marriages to place her descendants in royal families all over Europe. In doing so, she created one of the most remarkable royal families in history. By the early 19th century, Europe had been at war for decades. After the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars killed millions, European leaders came together to restore peace by reshaping major states for a new balance of power. Great Britain went on to become one of the strongest states. And years later, Queen Victoria and her husband Albert came up with a plan to maintain that political power — they married their children to monarchs across Europe. By the 1880s Queen Victoria’s children were in several important branches of Europe’s monarchies. The royal unions didn't play out as Queen Victoria planned, but she continued to make more matches anyway. She had 42 grandchildren, and these 7 ended up on royal thrones. Her grandchildren would end up on the thrones of Britain, Russia, Germany, Romania, Norway, and Spain leading up to the most destructive war Europe had ever seen.  To truly understand the international conflicts and trends shaping our world you need a big-picture view.

James explains: http://bit.ly/1Pzy1k5____________Richard ""the Challenger"" Cutland, ex British tankie and military specialist at Wargaming, stops by to talk about the types of tanks involved in the Battle of Kursk! Early in Operation Barbarossa, the Germans didn't expect much from their opponents. They did not know about the T-34 and KV-1 tanks, which turned out to be superior designs. The Germans deployed a special commission to study Soviet tank designs and soon introduced the Tiger, Panther, and Ferdinand tanks which Hitler believed were key to victory. The Panther in particular was now outclassing Soviet tanks, but it had giant mechanical issues and broke down frequently. The Soviets had produced a new T-43 model tank, but it was designed to tackle the old German Panzer IV and didn't measure up well to the new German tanks. So they preferred to focus on the trusty T-34 tanks, which made up in speed and numbers what they lacked in range and firepower. The Kursk region also played to the Soviets' advantage in Russia: the dust storms and mudfields hindered air support from the Luftwaffe and the advance of the Wermacht. Erich von Manstein, the German commander, decided not to advance. Instead he yielded ground to the Soviets in an attempt to lure them into overextending. He successfully caught them out at the First Battle of Kharkov, but even though the Soviets suffered heavy casualties there, it wasn't enough to make a dent in their huge army. Manstein needed to do something more drastic. Both he and the Soviets recognized that the Soviet line had a weakness where it bulged out to defend the city of Kursk, making it an obvious target for the next stage of operations.____________♫ Get the intro music here!http://bit.ly/1EQA5N7   *Music by Demetori: http://bit.ly/1AaJG4H♫ Outro music provided courtesy of Wargaming!""Reading 'Stars and Stripes'"" by Sergey Khmelevskyhttp://bit.ly/1Oak2wZ",history

BmZ8Miogq54,The History of North Sentinel Island - And Why it's Illegal to Visit,"With the killing of US Missionary John Allen Chau on the 25th November 2018, a small island in the Indian Ocean called North Sentinel Island became a household name - and his Neolithic, violently isolationist, tribal Sentinelese killers the subject of amazement and mystery. Having lived on their island for around 60,000, they are the modern population group we know the least about, every attempt to land on North Sentinel Island ending in an attack mounted by armed tribesmen on the beach.

Ambrose's 1992 non-fiction book of the same name. The executive producers were Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, who had collaborated on the 1998 World War II film Saving Private Ryan. The episodes first aired in 2001 on HBO. The series won Emmy and Golden Globe awards in 2001 for best miniseries.The series dramatizes the history of ""Easy"" Company (part of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division) from jump training in the United States through its participation in major actions in Europe, and up until Japan's capitulation and war's end. The events portrayed are based on Ambrose's research and recorded interviews with Easy Company veterans. The series took literary license, adapting the recorded history for the purposes of dramatic effect and series structure. All of the characters portrayed are based on members of Easy Company. Some of the men were recorded in contemporary interviews, which viewers see as preludes to each episode. The men's identities are not revealed until the finale.The title for the book and the series comes from the St Crispin's Day Speech in William Shakespeare's play Henry V, delivered by Henry V of England before the Battle of Agincourt. Ambrose quotes a passage from the speech on his book's first page; this passage is spoken by Carwood Lipton in the series' finale.",history

This episode covers the rival alliances that dominated Europe in the build-up to war, the Triple Alliance and the Triple Entente, and the fatal gunshots by Gavrilo Princip at Sarajevo that resulted in the death of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the throne of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Imperial rivalries, the system of alliances and deep-seated animosities helped propel Europe into a general war. However Woodrow Wilson, the US President, ensured America stood apart from Europe's conflict. In August 1914, Germany invaded France and Belgium as part of the Schlieffen Plan. The tiny British Expeditionary Force could only hold up the German army for a few hours at the Battle of Mons, but later joined the French in saving Paris at the Battle of the Marne. The 'Race to the Sea' followed, leading to the First Battle of Ypres, as both sides tried to outflank each other to the north. Their failure led to a stalemate, in which the devastating power of machineguns and artillery forced infantry of both sides to take cover in deep trenches. At sea, Britain's Royal Navy won the war's first naval battle at Heligoland Bight, and imposed a naval blockade on Germany, preventing war supplies (including, controversially, food) from reaching the country by sea. HMS Pathfinder was soon sunk by a German U-boat, revealing the potential of Germany's submarines to overturn Britain's long-held naval dominance.On the Eastern Front, a Russian invasion of East Prussia ended in disaster at the Battle of Tannenberg, masterminded by German generals Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff. A second victory at the Battle of Masurian Lakes sent the Russian army into retreat. Austria-Hungary's invasion of Serbia began badly, with defeat at the Battle of Cer. Things went even worse on the Russian front, as Austria's offensive against the Russians leads to heavy losses, and forced Germany to come to the rescue, by launching the Battle of Łódź.In Africa, British, French and German colonial forces clashed in British East Africa (Kenya), Togoland (Togo), German South-West Africa (Namibia), and German Kamerun (Cameroon). German Colonel Paul von Lettow-Vorbek had notable success repelling the British at the Battle of Tanga. In the Pacific, Japan honoured its alliance with Britain and seized the German naval base at Tsingtao in China. Task forces from Australia and New Zealand secured the German colonies of Samoa and New Guinea. German Admiral von Spee's East Asia Squadron won victory at the Battle of Coronel, off Chile, before sailing into catastrophe at the Battle of the Falkland Islands. In the Middle East, British troops occupied Basra, securing access to Persian oil for their fleet.Winter 1914 saw the French launch their first major offensive to break the trench stalemate of the Western Front. But the First Battle of Champagne led to heavy losses for no real gains. Ottoman operations in the Caucasus Mountains also ended in disaster at the Battle of Sarikamish. The war's first Christmas was marked by games of football in No Man's Land on the Western Front, but early hopes of a short war had now been entirely quashed.CORRECTION: 7.55 - the map shows Cyprus as part of the Ottoman Empire. Cyprus was part of the Ottoman Empire from 1570 to 1914, but when the Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers in November 1914, Cyprus was annexed by Britain.

This new South Sea Company will have a monopoly on trade in the rich new lands of South America, but all the ports there are controlled by Spain, with whom Britain is at war. So Blunt pushes the country into a premature and unfavorable peace with Spain, enlisting famous authors to write his propaganda and convincing Queen Anne herself to tip the balance of Parliament in his favor. After the queen dies and the government changes hands, Blunt kicks Harley and his Tory leaders out of the company. He manages to bring King George I himself on board as a ceremonial leader, linking the success of the South Sea Company with the reputation of the monarchy. But while his maneuvering inflates the value of his company's stock, it's never produced anything close to the amount of money he's convinced people to invest in it.___________Get the intro music here!http://bit.ly/1EQA5N7   *Music by Demetori: http://bit.ly/1AaJG4HListen to the outro music here!http://bit.ly/1ERCS9G__________James Recommends - City Building Games Across the AgesAnno Series (Dawn of Discovery): http://bit.ly/18mJxPgExtra Credits - How High Costs Drive Players Away from F2P GamesFree to Play is Currently Broken: http://bit.ly/1AobnQV",history

They describe Nibiru as many times the diameter of Earth, and abundant with iron oxide, making its rivers and lakes appear red. A side note about Nibiru:  according to the Sumerian tablets, Nibiru’s atmosphere began to deteriorate and became a hostile place for life, and in order to restore it, the Annunaki needed one important element for their atmosphere:  gold.Music: Kevin Macleod - Rites (Royalty Free)Cowritten and Narrated by Elisabeth Firestone: info@BestNarrator.comScenes from the following productions were used under Fair Use for educational purposes:History Channel's Ancient Aliens PBS NOVA's Secrets of Noah's Ark 2015 Ancient Sumerian History and Anunnaki Culture - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8sLX...

iloQeu-Yg7U,The Biggest Lies Told in History,"From legends about George Washington to historical monuments, here are the Biggest Lies told in History.  Subscribe to American Eye http://goo.gl/GBphkv10. Columbus Discovered America9. Paul Revere8. 13 Colonies7. Washington Cherry Tree6. The Crossing of the Delaware5. Van Gogh Cut off EarWhile in school, learning about famous artists, we all know that Van Gogh was simply a mad man who sliced off his ear and mailed it to his lover, right? Who would really inflict that much physical pain on themselves over an ex? After looking through quite a few letters and it seems more than likely that him and a friend of his got into a scuffle involving too much French wine and a sword. Which normally don’t mix too well. Van Gogh was certainly no snitch and didn’t want to report the incident that could potentially put his best friend in prison. 4. Sphinx NoseHow did the Sphinx lose it’s nose? Did it get a bad Rhinoplasty?  Or was While Napoleon was invading Egypt, he used the nose as a target practice for his cannons. This is another absurd historical legend that many still might believe. The nose was gone centuries before Napoleon was even born. Napoleon was fascinated with Egyptology and sought to preserve egypt’s antiquities. The limestone used to construct the sphinx eroded fairly quickly after a few thousand years had gone by. But Egypt is a Muslim country where worshipping idols is not permitted and it’s still a wonder how this monument is still here. Historical accounts from the 1400’s say that a religious islamist leader, Muhammad Sa’im al Dahr, destroyed the nose when he saw people worshipping the sphinx as an idol. 3. Vikings Horned HelmetsArchaeologists have a better chance of finding a unicorn than finding a horned viking helmet. Even the football team the Vikings, have horns on their helmet. This is just a modern day myth and an artist's portrayal of how the vikings actually looks while in battle. Thiss portrayal began in the 1800’s when scandinavians artists such as Malmstrom and Mary McGregor included this style of helmet, like we see in this illustration of Leif Ericsson discovering Vineland. Horned helmets did exist but these were over a couple thousand of years ago during the bronze age and used for ritualistic religious ceremonies2. StonehengeOne of the biggest ancient mysteries in the world is certainly stonehenge and they’ve been standing in that formation for 5000 years. Oh no don’t tell me this is a lie too. Could this all be some kind of cruel hoax? Historical records of the monument date back to about 1200 AD but it’s highly doubtful that they’ve been in the same position we see them today.  A curator from Cambridge University quoted,”Nearly all the stones we see today have been moved in some way and are standing in concrete.” This image we see here shows stonehenge in 1877 with stones leaning on eachother. Many monuments around the world must be restored at some point. This photo here shows some type of restoration project going on in 1898 with two men on top of a block that looks like it’s being placed there with a crane.  This photo shows the crane picking up the block and you can clearly tell this is a massive restoration project. Take a look at the photos and let us know what you believe. 1. First ThanksgivingSorry Guys, American eye has to ruin thanksgiving for you too. And there’s absolutely no truth to this one besides the feast itself and what we celebrate couldn’t be anything further from the truth! As a kid you might have believed your teacher saying that thanksgiving was a friendly celebration between Indians and Pilgrims who came together and feasted on Turkey legs and corn, sharing farming secrets. Thanksgiving was basically a celebration after a vengeful retaliation on native americans and it was celebrated around the same time each year. We won’t get into all the details but if you know how history tended to go between European settlers and Native Americans, you can probably take a good guess. Anyways, don’t let it keep you from enjoying some stuffing and turkey, which the pilgrims never ate",history

Jzl9Q3g35ow,PHILIPPINES: The Hidden History of Ancient Kingdoms and Empires,"-This video is not an Anti-Hispanic culture documentary and doesn't aim to abolished Hispanic/American culture in Philippines, I think it's important to remember that we need to appreciate every collective culture that history has throwned to the islands of the Philippines, for it would be a monument of the richness of the country, to remind every Filipinos that many great nations with different cultures of the world have fought for it's richness but in the end it was taken back by the Filipino people, and the Filipino people alone. That way they can feel a sense of uniqueness among the other Asian cultures! i don't want this video to be misunderstoodplus it could make Spain and America get away with everything they did while colonizing The Philippines, if Filipinos just erase the culture as if that part of history never happened. I personally saw it happening today. Some Spanish or even Mexican and Americans people today are rejecting the fact that they did colonized Philippines at all. Why? because Filipinos are destroying every evidence of it from their cultures and architectures[for more info watch: https://goo.gl/eN6Xnk ] thinking they belong to Asia when that is not the case! Colonial era is already part of Philippine history! and no matter what, history will never change! European cultures is already passed to Philippines and you cannot forced it not to.Colonial history is the only part of history that has a direct contact with the pre-colonial era as it is the sequel of the story,...  if the rejection of colonial evidence(demolishing many heritage cities instead of rebuilding a replicating it) still continues, even history of colonization might even be rejected as a myth and this is very possible.This Video only aims to let them appreicate the lost Pre-Hispanic cultures too.The Lost History of Ancient Philippine Kingdoms and Empires, Unknown to present day mainstream Philippine Education.

Filipino culture and History is very beautiful you only need to realize it.Update: this is not a Chinese propaganda, this video does not claim that China originally owns Philippines including spratlys. watch the whole thing![Also Watch old Manila heritage story:https://goo.gl/eN6Xnk Warsaw,Poland(the most damaged city in the world) did replicated it's old beauty and build their heritage structure authentically, so why not Manila? every other city in Metro Manila should be modern with tall skyscrapers like BGC, they're just new cities anyway! but The City of Manila is very very old with a lots of stories to tell, the city should be where we see a glimpse of beautiful past.]i do not own this",history

John does this by exploring the totally awesome history book ""The Columbian Exchange"" by Alfred Cosby, Jr. After Columbus ""discovered"" the Americas, European conquerors, traders, and settlers brought all manner of changes to the formerly isolated continents. Disease and invasive plant and animal species remade the New World, usually in negative ways. While native people, plants, and animals were being displaced in the Americas, the rest of the world was benefitting from American imports, especially foods like maize, tomatoes, potatoes, pineapple, blueberries, sweet potatoes, and manioc.

1-JAx3nUwms,A Brief History of Pi,"Get 10% off Squarespace by following this link: http://squarespace.com/simonclarkCheck out my new website here! https://www.simonoxfphys.com/Note that there's a huge amount about pi that I didn't cover in this video due to time - I didn't even mention proofs of it being irrational and transcendental, or why we call it pi! I chose to focus on the development of its approximation as a hook to teach the broader history of mathematics, rather than make this video an exhaustive list of facts. The wiki is a great place to learn more about the rest of the number's history and applications in maths and physics: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi#History A few nitpicky things:- I made mistakes distinguishing between 'digits of pi calculated' and 'decimal points of pi calculated' in some sections, so it is possible that this error is elsewhere without me knowing.- Archimedes didn't do his approximation with squares, he started with hexagons and then increased the order of the polygon. I chose to present the zeroth order version of his algorithm using squares for simplicity, but note that this is not what he did.- Something which got lost from the final version of this video is my argument that during the Age of Enlightenment pi shifted from being a physical (measured) constant to a purely logical (theoretical) one. This then embodies the philosophical shift in society at the time. This is hinted at but not fully explained, so I thought I'd put this here.- Lastly, I am truly sorry for the pronunciations which I doubtlessly completely murdered in this video. At least I spared you my attempt at Chinese.I am hugely indebted to Alex Bellos and his excellent book Alex's Adventures in Numberland for the inspiration to make this video. There is an entire chapter of the book devoted to a broader but shallower discussion of pi and its history, which I highly recommend.You can support the channel by donating at http://www.patreon.com/simonoxfphys---------- II ----------Huge thanks to my supporters on Patreon: Dan Hanvey, David Efird,  Elliot Conway, Robert Eldon, Syafiq Kay, Xavier Chesterfield, Jay Wright, Myles Kornfeld, Louis Gillet, Michael Phillips, Neudys Almonte, Fraser Birks, Martin Hermes, Anh Duong, Luca Schumann, Rhys Rickard-Frost, Cameron Matchett, Lachlan Woods, Tim Boxall, Simon Vaes, Gabriele Mozzicato, Jawad Alalasi, Gaia Frazao Nery, Kodzo, Josh Ruby, Claire Anthony, Eve Dillon, Rowan Gow, Matthias Loos, James Bridges, James Craig, Angela, Sanaa Al Derei, Mark Anthony Magro, Liam, Theresa Wang, Kieran Kelly, Wendover Productions, Kendra Johnson, Caitlin Louise.---------- II ----------Vlogs from Oxford students - http://www.youtube.com/oxvlogMy twitter - http://www.twitter.com/simonoxfphysMy facebook - http://www.facebook.com/youtubesimonMy insta - http://www.instagram.com/simonoxfphysMy goodreads - http://www.goodreads.com/simonoxfphysThanks to Vlogbrothers for their sponsorship of this video.

T6c-umQ_hlc,A History of Evil,"Animated Documentary-Mockumentary about Evil in western civilization from Ancient Greece to present day.The film was intended to show what people have believed in and pointed to as evil throughout history.  It was meant to get you to think about what evil really is. It is meant to show that when we get too obsessed with ""evil"" we might end up taking part in it ourselves. One has to separate evil and human cruelty. Human cruelty is people not being nice to one another. Evil is soemthing else, it is something we have created, a word and a concept for things that are not acceptable. It is a label for things that we do not understand and dont want to understand. But is evil really ever a complete explanation for anything?A lot of bad deeds has been done in the name of good. The people that did them ment good, are they evil?OK, and finally,This video is not meant to:-blame wester culture and people for all the ""evil"" in the world. I'm european, and thought that I better stick to my own history.-blame religion for all the evil in the world.-claim that God is dead. (It is simply a reference to the philosopher Nietzsche, look him up.)-offend anyone, race, religion, gender or sexual orientation.-claim that Elvis was evil.-be an exact and complete account of the actual events that has taken place throughout history. This was a student project, hence the ""unfinishedness"" and abrupt ending. I ran out of time. I might update it later.It was animated frame by frame in flash and composited and textured in AfterEffects.",history

rY9zHNOjGrs,"The Civil War, Part I: Crash Course US History #20","In which John Green ACTUALLY teaches about the Civil War. In part one of our two part look at the US Civil War, John looks into the causes of the war, and the motivations of the individuals who went to war. The overarching causes and the individual motivations were not always the same, you see. John also looks into why the North won, and whether that outcome was inevitable. The North's industrial and population advantages are examined, as are the problems of the Confederacy, including its need to build a nation at the same time it was fighting a war. As usual, John doesn't get much into the actual battle by battle breakdown. He does talk a little about the overarching strategy that won the war, and Grant's plan to just overwhelm the South with numbers. Grant took a lot of losses in the latter days of the war, but in the end, it did lead to the surrender of the South.

alJaltUmrGo,Imperialism: Crash Course World History #35,"In which John Green teaches you about European Imperialism in the 19th century. European powers started to create colonial empires way back in the 16th century, but businesses really took off in the 19th century, especially in Asia and Africa. During the 1800s, European powers carved out spheres of influence in China, India, and pretty much all of Africa. While all of the major (and some minor) powers in Europe participated  in this new imperialism, England was by far the most dominant, once able to claim that the ""sun never set on the British Empire."" Also, they went to war for the right to continue to sell opium to the people of China. Twice. John will teach you how these empires managed to leverage the advances of the Industrial Revolution to build vast, wealth-generating empires. As it turns out, improved medicine, steam engines, and better guns were crucial in the 19th century conquests. Also, the willingness to exploit and abuse the people and resources of so-called ""primitive"" nations was very helpful in the whole enterprise.

Gibson portrays William Wallace, a 13th-century Scottish warrior who led the Scots in the First War of Scottish Independence against King Edward I of England. The story is based on Blind Harry's epic poem The Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant Campioun Schir William Wallace and was adapted for the screen by Randall Wallace.The film was nominated for ten Academy Awards at the 68th Academy Awards and won five: Best Picture, Best Makeup, Best Cinematography, Best Sound Editing, and Best Director.Randall Wallace, who wrote the screenplay, has acknowledged Blind Harry's 15th century epic poem The Acts and Deeds of Sir William Wallace, Knight of Elderslie as a major inspiration for the film.[26] In defending his script, Randall Wallace has said, ""Is Blind Harry true? I don't know. I know that it spoke to my heart and that's what matters to me, that it spoke to my heart.""[26] Blind Harry's poem is now not regarded as historically accurate, and although some incidents in the film which are not historically accurate are taken from Blind Harry (e.g. the hanging of Scottish nobles at the start), [27] there are large parts which are based neither on history nor Blind Harry (e.g. Wallace's affair with Princess Isabelle).Elizabeth Ewan describes Braveheart as a film which ""almost totally sacrifices historical accuracy for epic adventure"".[28] The ""brave heart"" refers in Scottish history to that of Robert the Bruce, and an attribution by William Edmondstoune Aytoun, in his poem Heart of Bruce, to Sir James the Good Douglas: ""Pass thee first, thou dauntless heart, As thou wert wont of yore!"", prior to Douglas' demise at the Battle of Teba in Andalusia.[29] It has been described as one of the most historically inaccurate modern films.[30]Sharon Krossa notes that the film contains numerous historical errors, beginning with the wearing of belted plaid by Wallace and his men. In that period ""no Scots ... wore belted plaids (let alone kilts of any kind)."" Moreover, when Highlanders finally did begin wearing the belted plaid, it was not ""in the rather bizarre style depicted in the film"". She compares the inaccuracy to ""a film about Colonial America showing the colonial men wearing 20th century business suits, but with the jackets worn back-to-front instead of the right way around.""[31] ""The events aren't accurate, the dates aren't accurate, the characters aren't accurate, the names aren't accurate, the clothes aren't accurate—in short, just about nothing is accurate.""[32] The belted plaid (feileadh mór léine) was not introduced until the 16th century.[33] Peter Traquair has referred to Wallace's ""farcical representation as a wild and hairy highlander painted with woad (1,000 years too late) running amok in a tartan kilt (500 years too early)."" [34]In 2009, the film was second on a list of ""most historically inaccurate movies"" in The Times.[30] In the humorous non-fictional historiography An Utterly Impartial History of Britain (2007), author John O'Farrell notes that Braveheart could not have been more historically inaccurate, even if a ""Plasticine dog"" had been inserted in the film and the title changed to William Wallace and Gromit.",history

While always feeling responsible to history to capture complex issues and moments in a single frame, this responsibility is made personal for Samantha Appleton, now as a mother.  Samantha Appleton is a photographer concentrating on historical trends. Her work strives to show that quiet, subtle moments make up the complicated components of large news stories. The bulk of her career has covered many of the most tumultuous, man-made events of the past decade. Primary stories have included conflict in Iraq, Afghanistan and Lebanon, social issues in Africa, and immigration in the US. She has won numerous awards including Pictures of the Year, World Press Master Class, American Photography and Camera Arts. She was most recently an Official White House Photographer for the Obama administration during the first term. In addition to her photography, she is currently writing a non-fiction book project about Iraq. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx",history

In the late 19th and early 20th century in America, there was a sense that things could be improved upon. A sense that reforms should be enacted. A sense that progress should be made. As a result, we got the Progressive Era, which has very little to do with automobile insurance, but a little to do with automobiles. All this overlapped with the Gilded Age, and is a little confusing, but here we have it. Basically, people were trying to solve some of the social problems that came with the benefits of industrial capitalism. To oversimplify, there was a competition between the corporations' desire to keep wages low and workers' desire to have a decent life. Improving food safety, reducing child labor, and unions were all on the agenda in the Progressive Era. While progress was being made, and people were becoming more free, these gains were not equally distributed. Jim Crow laws were put in place in the south, and immigrant rights were restricted as well. So once again on Crash Course, things aren't so simple.Hey teachers and students - Check out CommonLit's free collection of reading passages and curriculum resources to learn more about the events of this episode.

So how did this war happen? And what does it mean? We've all learned the facts about World War II many times over, thanks to repeated classroom coverage, the History channel, and your grandfather (or maybe great-grandfather) showing you that Nazi bayonet he used to keep in his sock drawer and telling you a bunch of age-inappropriate stories about his harrowing war experiences.  So, why did the Axis powers think forceful expansion was a good idea? (they were hungry). So why did this thing shake out in favor of the Allies? HInt: it has to do with the fact that it was a world war.  Germany and Japan made some pretty serious strategic errors, such as invading Russia and attacking the United States, and those errors meant that pretty much the whole world was against them. So, find out how this worldwide alliance came together to stop the Axis expansion. All this, plus Canada finally gets the respectful treatment it deserves.

ZTC_RxWN_xo,Secret History of Silicon Valley,"[Recorded: November 20, 2008]Today, Silicon Valley is known around the world as a fount of technology innovation and development fueled by private venture capital and peopled by fabled entrepreneurs. But it wasn't always so. Unbeknownst to even seasoned inhabitants, today's Silicon Valley had its start in government secrecy and wartime urgency.In this lecture, renowned serial entrepreneur Steve Blank presents how the roots of Silicon Valley sprang not from the later development of the silicon semiconductor but instead from the earlier technology duel over the skies of Germany and secret efforts around (and over) the Soviet Union. World War II, the Cold War and one Stanford professor set the stage for the creation and explosive growth of entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley. The world was forever changed when the Defense Department, CIA and the National Security Agency acted like today's venture capitalists funding this first wave of entrepreneurship. Steve Blank shows how these groundbreaking early advances lead up to the high-octane, venture capital fueled Silicon Valley we know today.Catalog Number: 102695046Lot Number: X5082.2009",history

BGjVbnU-TpA,"क्यूँ आये थे मुघल भारत में , जानिये असलीयत इतिहासकी  | History Of India","क्यूँ आयेथे मुघल भारत में , जानिये असलीयत इतिहासकी  | History Of IndiaThe Mughal Empire (also referred to as Baburid Empire, Baburid Dynasty) was founded by Zahiriddin Muhammad Babur, a Timurid prince and ruler from Turan or Turkistan, i.e. Central Asia (Uzbekistan). Babur was a direct descendant to the Turkic Emperor Timur on his father's side and also had links to Chagatai, the second son of the Mongol ruler Genghis Khan, on his mother’s side.Ousted from his ancestral domains in Turkistan by Sheybani Khan, the 14-year old Prince Babur turned to India to satisfy his ambitions. He established himself in Kabul and then pushed steadily southward into India from Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass. Babur's forces occupied much of northern India after his victory at Panipat in 1526. The preoccupation with wars and military campaigns, however, did not allow the new emperor to consolidate the gains he had made in India.The instability of the empire became evident under his son, Humayun, who was driven out of India and into Persia by rebels.Humayun's exile in Persia established diplomatic ties between the Safavid and Mughal Courts, and led to increasing West Asian cultural influence in the Mughal court. The restoration of Mughal rule began after Humayun’s triumphant return from Persia in 1555, but he died from a fatal accident shortly afterwards.Humayun's son, Akbar, succeeded to the throne under a regent, Bairam Khan, who helped consolidate the Mughal Empire in India.Through warfare and diplomacy, Akbar was able to extend the empire in all directions, and controlled almost the entire Indian subcontinent north of the Godavari river. He created a new class of nobility loyal to him from the military aristocracy of India's social groups, implemented a modern government and supported cultural developments. At the same time Akbar intensified trade with European trading companies. The Indian historian Abraham Eraly wrote that foreigners were often impressed by the fabulous wealth of the Mughal court, but the glittering court hid darker realities, namely that about a quarter of the empire's gross national product was owned by 655 families while the bulk of India's 120 million people lived in appalling poverty.After suffering what appears to have been an epileptic seizure in 1578 while hunting tigers, which he regarded as a religious experience, Akbar grew disenchanted with Islam, and came to embrace a syncretistic mixture of Hinduism and Islam.Akbar allowed free expression of religion and attempted to resolve socio-political and cultural differences in his empire by establishing a new religion, Din-i-Ilahi, with strong characteristics of a ruler cult. He left his successors an internally stable state, which was in the midst of its golden age, but before long signs of political weakness would emerge. Akbar's son, Jahangir, ruled the empire at its peak, but he was addicted to opium, neglected the affairs of the state, and came under the influence of rival court cliques. During the reign of Jahangir's son, Shah Jahan, the culture and splendour of the luxurious Mughal court reached its zenith as exemplified by the Taj Mahal.The maintenance of the court, at this time, began to cost more than the revenueSubscribe Us : https://goo.gl/mRFqpS",history

Crash Course doesn't usually talk much about dates, but the way that things unfolded in July and August of 1914 are kind of important to understanding the Great War. You'll learn about Franz Ferdinand, Gavrilo Pincep, the Black Hand, and why the Serbian nationalists wanted to kill the poor Archduke. You'll also learn who mobilized first and who exactly started the war. Sort of. Actually there's no good answer to who started the war, but we give it a shot anyway.You can directly support Crash Course at https://www.patreon.com/crashcourse Subscribe for as little as $0 to keep up with everything we're doing.

Not only that, they also struggled against abuse – both physical and mental – by racist members of society.  Starting with the right to vote, and then laboring to integrate schools and other aspects of everyday life, the Civil Rights Movement made huge strides over a century of work.  While the crusade may never truly be over, many considered the election of the country’s first African American President to be a turning point in the battle.

The people went to arty school. They made their paints by mixing acid wash and lemonadeIn my brain I re-arrange the letters on the page to spell your nameI found an ezra pound and made a bet that if i found a cigarette i'd drop it all and marry you.Just then a song comes on: ""you can't always get what you want"" -- the rolling stones, oh woe is we, the irony!The stones became the moss and once all inhibitions lost, the hipsters made a mission to the farm.We drove by tractor there, the yellow straw replaced our hair, we laced the dairy river with the cream of sweet vermouth.In my brain I re-arrange the letters on the page to spell your nameYou said ""we only live once"" so we touched a little tongue, and instantly i wanted to...I lost my train of thought and jumped aboard the Epping as the doors were slowly closing on the world.I touched on and off and rubbed my arm up against yours and still the inspector inspected me.The lady in the roof was living proof that nothing really ever is exactly as it seems.In my brain I re-arrange the letters on the page to spell your nameWe caught the river boat downstream and ended up beside a team of angry footballers.I fed the ducks some krill then we were sucked against our will into the welcome doors of the casino.We drank green margaritas, danced with sweet senoritas, and we all went home as winners of a kind.You said ""i guarantee we'll have more fun, drink till the moon becomes the sun, and in the taxi home i'll sing you a triffids song!""In my brain I re-arrange the letters on the page to spell your name",history

dC_2WXyORGA,A History of Earth's Climate,"Earth had a climate long before we showed up and started noticing it and it's influenced by a whole series of cycles that have been churning along for hundreds of millions of years. In most cases those cycles will continue long after we're gone. A look at the history of climate change on Earth can give us some much needed perspective on our current climate dilemma because the surprising truth is, what we're experiencing now is different than anything this planet has encountered before. So, let's take a stroll down Climate History Lane and see if we can find some answers to a question that's been bugging Hank a lot lately - just how much hot water are we in?Like SciShow?

Hillary was raised in a suburb of Illinois where she attended public school and was raised a Methodist by her parents. She attended Wellesley College, and went on to study law at Yale. After attending Yale Law School, she went to work for the Children’s Defense Fund, going door to door in New Bedford, Massachusetts. After serving as a lawyer for the Congressional Committee investigating President Nixon, she moved to Arkansas where she taught law and ran legal clinics representing poor people. She co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, one of the state’s first child advocacy groups. As First Lady under President Bill Clinton, Hillary tenaciously led the fight to reform our health care system so that all our families have access to the care they need at affordable prices. Hillary led the U.S. delegation to Beijing to attend the UN Fourth World Conference on Women and gave a groundbreaking speech, declaring that “human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights once and for all”—inspiring women worldwide and helping to galvanize a global movement for women’s rights and opportunities. Hillary was then elected to the U.S. Senate, becoming the first woman senator from New York.  She repeatedly worked across the aisle to get things done, including working alongside Republicans after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. When Congress wouldn't do enough for rural areas and small towns, Hillary didn’t back down. She launched innovative partnerships with the tech industry and provided support to local colleges and small businesses. When President Obama asked Hillary to serve as his secretary of state, she answered the call to public service once again. She was a forceful champion for human rights, internet freedom, and rights and opportunities for women and girls, LGBT people and young people all around the globe. Now she’s running for President because everyday Americans need a champion and she wants to be that champion.ABOUT THE HILLARY CLINTON YOUTUBE CHANNELWelcome to Hillary Clinton’s YouTube Channel.

They are one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India.[The temples are famous for their nagara-style architectural symbolism and their erotic sculptures.Most Khajuraho temples were built between 950 and 1050 by the Chandela dynasty.

Of these, only about 25 temples have survived, spread over 6 square kilometers.Of the various surviving temples, the Kandariya Mahadeva Temple is decorated with a profusion of sculptures with intricate details, symbolism and expressiveness of ancient Indian artThe Khajuraho group of temples were built together but were dedicated to two religions, Hinduism and Jainism, suggesting a tradition of acceptance and respect for diverse religious views among Hindus and Jains in the regionSubscribe to our Travel Channel :https://goo.gl/8OOVvV #khajuraho #sculptures #khajurahosculptures #templeoflove #historyofkhajuraho - Khajuraho Group Of Monuments | History of The Khajuraho Sculptures |",history

k7ngnWJ6Hks,Music is a visual art | Hunter Ewen | TEDxBoulder,"This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. We can use visuals to better describe music. Hunter Ewen is a dramatic music composer, educator, and multimedia designer. During the day, Dr. Ewen teaches strategies for digital creativity at the University of Colorado, the children’s collaborative art center Reel Kids, the City of Longmont, and as an independent educator. At night, he composes, solders, choreographs, and directs interdisciplinary projects around the world. Experimental performance practices and unusual notation figure prominently in Ewen’s works. A believer that compositions should be both seen and heard, his music looks as strange as it sounds. Swirles, squiggles, arrows, and fangs often replace traditional notes and rests. His aesthetic preferences gravitate towards yowls and yips and wails and squeals. Towards screams that masquerade as art. Towards clamor and deviance. Ewen’s music swings from chandeliers.About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",art and music

Years ago, my boss at the time had in his office a coffee table book of photos of homeless people. The pictures humanized homeless men, woman, and families as the real people that they are. I said to myself: ""I could do this with video."" Shortly after, I was laid off and Invisible People was started. If you'd like to learn more about my story and how Invisible People started, please watch this documentary https://youtu.be/z0wDn9SAWZsArt and music have the power to bring people together and change our world for the better. Both art and music can play a huge role in giving homeless people a purpose. Yes, housing ends homelessness but just putting homeless people in boxes will never end homelessness. People need to thrive and not just survive. Art therapy and music therapy are powerful tools for wellness, and as you'll see in this vlog - art, music, and theater can be used for advocacy to help change policy. Last year, With One Voice sent a delegation to the ATSA État d'Urgence Festival in Montreal, Canada. It was an amazing few days meeting new friends and brainstorming on how we can help other creative organizations scale to have more impact helping homeless people. I shot a bunch of footage but never got around to editing it into something until this month. My dream is someday to be able to produce mini-documentaries like this vlog highlighting cool ideas and amazing people working to end homelessness who may not always get a lot of media attention.  For example, in this vlog, I reference a video I shot when I was invited to the Dallas Public Library that you can watch here: https://youtu.be/_SaG0xR7xkU The folks behind With One Voice saw this video and invited Jo and Heather to Montreal to share about creating safe spaces. I hope to one day be able to produce more like this but on a much larger scale! In her interview, Beth Knowles from the City of Manchester and With One Voice references the North America Review of Arts and Homelessness that you can find here: http://with-one-voice.com/north-ameri...From With One Voice's website: With One Voice began as a showcase event curated by Streetwise Opera at the 2012 Cultural Olympiad in London. For the first time in Olympic history, it gave a platform for homeless people – celebrating the artistic achievements of 300 performers who had experienced homelessness.To learn more about the people and the organizations in this video, here is a link to information about the delegates https://www.atsa.qc.ca/en/eu-2017-wit...

The vlog puts into context one of our nation’s most troubling and prevalent issues through personal stories captured by the lens of Mark Horvath – its founder – and brings into focus the pain, hardship and hopelessness that millions face each day. One story at a time, videos posted on InvisiblePeople.tv shatter the stereotypes of America’s homeless, force shifts in perception and deliver a call to action that is being answered by national brands, nonprofit organizations and everyday citizens now committed to opening their eyes and their hearts to those too often forgotten.Invisible People is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to changing the way we think about people experiencing homelessness.",art and music

Two ticket levels will be made available. General Admission will give access to the art installations as well as all musical performances on three stages for the entire weekend at a price of $185. VIP tickets are limited and will include front of stage pit access with private bar, complimentary beverages and small plates, access to private lounge, rapid entry, and commemorative lanyard for $750. Thousands of blind pre-sale tickets sold out in less than 24 hours when the event was announced in early September. Curator Alex Czetwertynski explains, “The festival's title, “Day For Night,” provides the main key to understand the work being presented, as that space between day/night or light/dark is where our perception gets the blurriest. All of the artists in our roster will, in one way or another, transform our feeling of time, space, perspective, and place. They were chosen because of their common use of computational media to manipulate light, time, and sound. Their approaches to light and sound can be literal, or purely as a medium to reveal content.  And with the large scale canvas that Day for Night is offering these artists, we can only expect this audio-visual exchange to be a heightened sensorial experience.”With acres of immersive installations within the emerging field of digital art and performances by world-class musicians, each are curated not just for their musical talent but also the visual qualities of their stage presence, Day For Night seeks to redefine the festival experience and inspire attendees to re-examine the way they interact with and understand both art and music.",art and music

This exhibition features an exciting selection of early work as well as very recent work by Ronnie and includes a number of portraits of The Rolling Stones. Created from an insider's perspective, Ronnie portrays his colleagues, his friends, and band-mates, both in group portraits and individually, with an insight and intimacy not accessible to anyone else. Through line and colour, he deftly captures the creative energy of his musical world, showing us a view different from what we might see in the concert hall or arena. Ronnie Wood is one of those rare artists who can express himself through both music and the visual arts, eloquently and expertly.http://www.thebenton.org/exb_current....",art and music

Xcmijqbd8kc,"'Hey Bill Nye, What's the Evolutionary Purpose of Music and Art?'","The impulse to create art and music comes from deep evolutionary drives, explains Bill Nye the Science Guy. In the animal kingdom, song and visual displays are great tools for, um, flirting.Read more at BigThink.com: http://bigthink.com/videos/bill-nye-o...Follow Big Think here:YouTube: http://goo.gl/CPTsV5Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BigThinkdotcomTwitter: https://twitter.com/bigthinkTranscript: Michael Montoya: Hi Bill. Michael Montoya here. What do you think is the evolutionary advantage to humanity being both musically and artistically creative? And where do you think this initial spark of creativity came from?Bill Nye: Michael. Michael. This is a great question and susceptible to speculation. Apparently music and art is part of the way we communicate and it's certainly the way you attract mates. I'll just put it to you that way. Musicians and artists engage other people in a way that people who don't use music and don't use art do not. Now, there's a lot of talk about songbirds in evolutionary biology and they all have these songs, which must be pleasing to the ears of their potential mates and also must send messages to others of their species, so I guess to other species as well. I am angry; this is my territory; I'm looking for a mate; it's a sunny day. These sort of announcements are made by other species so you figure humans have just taken it just a whole other level with albums and record release parties and art exhibits and art museums and art galleries. So it really is deep within us and I think art enriches our lives, engages our brains and stimulates us in a way that nothing else we do does. So, this is only speculation on my part but music especially certainly inspires us. That's for sure. So carry on Michael. Turn it up loud.",art and music

Emmanuel Gorrin is a junior student of neuroscience with a penchant for the arts — drawing, painting, and piano have been among his passions since childhood. Now, his interests lie in the role of art, music and technology in neural functioning and the advancement of medicine. He is the founder and President of Neuromission, a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping people with neurological disorders by integrating art, music and innovative technology. Emmanuel also hosts Get Smart! On WVUM 90.5 fm and can be heard discussing all things science each Tuesday at 7pm.

lgGf6WuUQro,"""Art and Music"" by Art and Music","https://www.klbinternationalpublishin...""Art and Music"" by Art and MusicLets be honest, Kasey Jones of Art and Music is currently not an award winning artist, songwriter or producer. If he had Record Company, Drug Cartel, Big Pharma, Government Military money he probably could be. Why? Because kids, you can buy your way to the top in this game we are all playing. Don't think you are a part of it? Think again and hit the books. So till the scales tip and above becomes below he will be frequently relocated to earth to fulfill his soul contract after numerous other glorious failed attempts.  He is passionate about making intimate and poignant songs using outdated and unreliable equipment in his living room. He's scrappy, hungry, skilled at burning bridges and primed to explode at any moment. Possibly implode. Art and Music's highly unanticipated second album “Who are They”, is a completely independent release. Jones produced, recorded, engineered and performed every instrument on this release, highlighting his versatility and broad musical scope. Further demonstrating his sheer insanity.One of the most exciting things about Art and Music is that Jones can exercise full creative control over every stage of the music-making experience, from conception to fruition!He blissfully watches mindless robot sheep perpetuate in consumer stupor, narrowly avoiding mental breakdowns most of the time.

0ADbFQkHyto,Music Art Meditation - Relax Your Mind and Soul with Art and Music,"Music Art Meditation provides you with a novel method of meditation to relax your Mind and Soul with Art and Music! Stay focused!Arguably, all music can be said to be useful for Meditation. The styles, cadences, arpeggiations, and rhythms of meditational music for contemplative practices is characteristically different than most other forms of music. Generally speaking, the music is relaxing, lacking definitive rhythms. Meditation and music have been relational partners for centuries. Mellow, repetitive, and redundant sequences of smoothly contoured melodic lines help to relax the mind as arrhythmic tempos do not distract the listener into a beat but rather a flow. Harmonies are often absent unless one accepts the musical nuance of imitation as structured harmony. Meditation music can also include recordings of sounds in the ""natural"" world: rainfall, waterfalls, birds, insects, whales, and others, separately and in synthetic combination.In the recent years, it was scientifically proven that relaxing art techniques combined with music is one of the best ways forward as it guarantees rapid positive results. So, our main goal is to share this relaxation method with you all.Music Art Meditation - Experience the Whole New Meditation Technique Using Music and Art!👍 Like 💬Comment ✅Share and ❤️Subscribe: Click on the Bell 🔔 to be Notified First to View 👀 the Videos!© MusicArtMeditation - MaM© #MusicArtMeditation-----------------------------------------------------Music Credits:""Tristan Lohengrin - The End Of The World"" is under a Creative Commons license (CC BY 3.0).Music promoted by BreakingCopyright: https://youtu.be/vp2xrvXh9M0-----------------------------------------------------",art and music

jvYTiPQAyAE,How art and music create a new hybrid global culture: Rajae El Mouhandiz at TEDxBreda,"The ""one story"" of Muslims and immigrants we hear in the news and politics every day is ignoring the many stories of millions of women and men who do not see themselves in that old story, but as authors and owners of a new story where globalism and hybrid cultures are the stage and vehicle. They represent a new story of being and belonging in the world. A story where history is honoured as the sacrifices of those who came before us. Their parents moved to the west to start something new, mixed with the old, and individuals like Rajae El Mouhandiz are the product. As the new stories they are shaping do not yet have a language and a platform, one has to start telling the stories through art and music. And personal strength.Regarding Rajae El MouhandizRajae El Mouhandiz is a Dutch-Moroccan-Algerian poet, singer, composer, producer, and founder of the record label Truthseeker Records. After leaving her family at age 15 and being the first Moroccan to study at a Dutch conservatory at age 16. El Mouhandiz left classical music at age 20 to follow her own artistic path, seeking to incorporate her cultural roots. She started her own record label at age 25, released two albums and is currently developing her third album in Morocco. On international women's day 2013 El Mouhandiz premiered her first short documentary film, about the acceptance of Muslim women in mainstream media and the music industry. Currently she is developing her second short film, focusing on her Maghreb heritage and the story of her grandfathers. She is also one of the 60 female curators of the groundbreaking international MUSLIMA exhibition, held in The USA, The Philipines, The U.A.E and Denmark. And together with the British Council Ireland and a Dutch theatre production company, El Mouhandiz is producing the Dutch and European version of the Hijabi Monologues; a theatre space for the experiences of Muslim women; a space to breathe as they are; a space that does not claim to tell every story and speak for every voice. The Dutch premiere is planned in September 2014. Rajae was nominated as Muslim Leader of tomorrow in 2005. She was nominated by Elsevier magazine as one of Hollands' 10 biggest talents in 2007, in the field of contemporary music and from 2009 -- 2012 she was the only female contemporary artist to be nominated on the list of the 500 most influential Muslims in the world. This year Rajae has been nominated for the 5th year in a row. More information: www.rajae.net",art and music

When I am faced with the whiteness of my creative page, I like to set limiting parameters before I begin my work. Choosing to limit my creative output can bring focus and direction. The following are a few examples of the concept of limitation:1. Georgia O'Keeffe uses soft and wavy curves in her paintings (example: Flower of Life II)2. Claude Debussy focuses on the pentatonic and the octatonic scales in his compositions.3. The game of chess limits the movements of the pieces both collectively and individually.Join me for more talks about art, inspiration, and all things creative.This episode features the music from my album Lacrimosa: http://www.dosiamckay.com/lacrimosa.s...My website: http://dosiamckay.com/My compositions: http://www.dosiamckay.com/recordings....My paintings: http://www.dosiamckay.com/art/gallery...My writing and poetry: https://musicwell.wordpress.com/Follow meFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dosiamckay/Twitter: https://twitter.com/dosiamckayGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+DosiaMcKayYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/dosiamckay",art and music

CQ4gxP2NGiQ,"Mathematics, Music, and Visual Art","Bridges 4: Mathematics, Music, and Visual ArtOur talks will explore some of the many connections between mathematics, music, and visual arts, using as a springboard our collaborative work-in-progress with the Kitchener-Waterloo symphony, to be premiered in April 2016. Dmitri will begin by describing the deep similarities between the languages of music and geometry, showing how elementary musical terms like “chord” and “voice leading” correspond to geometrical concepts like “vectors in an orbifold.” This correspondence in turn allows us to appreciate the hidden logic of particular pieces, the development of styles, and entire genres. Nathan will continue by showing how mathematical ideas can underwrite visually and conceptually striking visual art.

XCRbISUfU2Y,Convergence 2016: Electronic Music + Visual Art,"When it comes to Electronic Music + Visual Art, we have entered into a post-instrument era in which music and visual art born of technology produce contemporary, dynamic and convergent new forms. Traditional apparatus and techniques are displaced by computer based processes, virtual instruments, electronic hardware and custom machines, stems, patches, waveforms and midi. This inaugural residency welcomes artists working in rhythmic and experimental electronic music realms, digital visual artists, and those pursuing work that creates synergies between sound, music and art.This Banff Centre residency provided the context for artists to research, conceive, prototype and present new artistic works, tools, techniques and perspectives for electronic music, sound, and visual creation. Under the artistic direction of Patti Schmidt and Jen Mizuik, and led by faculty Robin Fox and Uwe Schmidt with guest faculty who are specialists in their fields, the program offered sessions and workshops on modular synthesizers, electronic music software and hardware, visual creation software and methods, artistic process and philosophy, and the nature of live performance in these technologically dominated fields. Together artists, peers, and world-renowned faculty exchanged knowledge, discussed ideas, experimented with processes, created, collaborated, performed, and shared artistic experiences.Artists presented their works-in-progress throughout the program. The nature of the practices involved determined the presentation format and ranged from live performances, informal presentations, installations, talks and workshops. Artists received technical and artistic guidance during the development of their projects and research. This video gives a glimpse into the coolness that was the 2016 Convergence Residency.Follow the Banff Centre:Website: https://banffcentre.caFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheBanffCentreTwitter: https://twitter.com/thebanffcentreiTunes: http://apple.co/1A2DMmxSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/banff-centre-r...",art and music

The Theta / Beta frequencies range from 6-7hz & 13-15hz respectively, with 8-12hz alpha waves interspersed throughout. The patterns switch in the following manner, every 5 minutes: 0-5 mins - Alpha / Beta; 5-10 mins - Theta / Alpha; 10 - 15 mins -Alpha / Beta; etc. etc.  up to one hour. This quick interplay between beta and theta/alpha promotes a balance between concrete thought and creative abstraction. This way we can encourage and bring to light new insights, generate new & original ideas, contemplate a concept from various points of view, and problem solve holistically. The beta phases serve to not only promote focus and concentration, but to also analyse, organise and therefore make sense of the abstractions derived from the more non linear holistic mind states induced by Theta and Alpha. In addition to using this audio during work or study, you can also use it in a rested state while meditating to assist with creative visualisation. As binaural beats have been integrated into this track, we recommend using headphones. Subscribe to The Brainwave Hub for the best brainwave entrainment audios, as well as our partner channel, The Meditation Music Hub: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCydP...--The Brainwave Hub offers high quality binaural beats and isochronic tones.

SDmdsuGr3KQ,Katawa Shoujo Beta - Shizune Act 3 (Full Art and Music),"Here is Shizune's Act 3. The official Steam forum dedicated to repairing the beta routes did not completely finish giving Shizune's route art and music direction, so I fixed it up myself. Knowing how to mod has never generated so many feels.This is a playthrough of Shizune's Act 3 in the Beta of Katawa Shoujo. Act 1 was skipped due to it being exactly the same aside from the music and some grammar errors. Act 2 has been uploaded at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4z3Rmw... I will upload Act 4 at some point in time, but I figured I should at least upload something pertaining to the beta route as of now instead of holding off everything.I decided to keep the beta music in, but upon my insertion of art and music I put in some of the final version's music instead. The beta music just seems to fit the majority of the story in this route much better.I came across a rather disturbing, yet slightly expected option in the beta that was either omitted or never finished. As it turns out, you could end up having sex with Misha at Shizune's house. During the scene where Misha confesses her love for Shizune, there was going to be a decision at some point in the conversation where you could choose to comfort her or refuse. If you do not comfort her, she tells you that she had a selfish thought that you would (this is shown at about 1:23:34 in the video) This effects multiple scenes, the most notable one being that Hisao and Misha agree to never tell Shizune about the affair. This in turn would not actually effect the story at all, but feelings of utter guilt would be inserted throughout many scenes. The most ridiculous part is that you could still get a good ending with Shizune, even after cheating on her, but I'll get into more detail about that once Act 4 comes along. For now, I will hold off the spoilers.Katawa Shoujo is a bishoujo-style visual novel set in the fictional Yamaku High School for disabled children, located somewhere in modern Japan. Hisao Nakai, a normal boy living a normal life, has his life turned upside down when a congenital heart defect forces him to move to a new school after a long hospitalization. Despite his difficulties, Hisao is able to find friends—and perhaps love, if he plays his cards right. There are five main paths corresponding to the 5 main female characters, each path following the storyline pertaining to that character. This is the beta.",art and music

By investigating the fundamental geometric forms of both Islamic art and Gothic architecture, there is a connection between religious influence, visual creativity and architectural  structure that strengthens physical capacity to the human experience. Relating these two art forms to music theory provides an introduction to the progress of music sciences in the modern age; including Cymatics, a 20th century science of wave phenomenon that demonstrates various geometric shapes of frequencies and musical pitch. This interdisciplinary approach of visualizing the common geometric forms of art, architecture, and music questions the anticipatory influence and outlook of the arts for future generations.",art and music

WJaR7rJqKIk,"Art and Incarceration:  Poetry, Theatre and Music in and about Captivity","For this interdisciplinary performance, Ensemble Pi presented music, text, and theater works that focus on the rise of mass incarceration, the racial disparities it reveals, and the emotional toll it takes on inmates and their families. The evening started with the world premiere of Rikers Island by New York composer Eleanor Cory, inspired by the anthology These Are Hard Times for Dreamers. Followed by Rzewski’s minimalist masterpiece, Coming Together, composed in the wake of the 1971 prison riots in upstate New York and powerfully expressing the frustration of life behind bars and anger about injustice. Joseph Assadourian, the narrator for Coming Together, will also perform an excerpt from his tragi-comic play, The Bullpen, based on his own incarceration. The performance closed with the sublime Olivier Messiaen’s Quartet for the End of Time (1941), composed and performed in the prisoner-of-war camp in Gorlitz, Germany, capturing the hardship and sadness of being in prison, while still conveying optimism.About the presenters:Ensemble Pi is a new music collective that uniquely connects pressing social and political issues and the idioms of classical contemporary music. They began a Peace Concerts series 10 years ago in response to the invasion of Iraq, and have since presented annual chamber music concerts giving voice to the struggle for peace. Every concert includes at least one commission, as well as contemporary classical masterpieces to address the historical tradition of “socially conscious” compositions. In the past, the group has collaborated with visual artists, writers, journalists and actors – including South African artist William Kentridge and American journalists Naomi Wolf and Jeremy Scahill – and have featured the music of John Harbison, Frederic Rzewski, Shostakovich and Penderecki. The Peace Concerts series has also protested the censorship of media, fracking, the Apartheid, and more. Performers include: Alexis Gerlach, cello; Moran Katz, clarinet; Idith Meshulam Korman, piano; Airi Yoshioka, violin; and Joseph Assadourian, actor and narrator. The group is joined by local Houston musicians Craig Hauschildt, percussion and Daniel Egan, trumpet.c Rothko Chapel/Runaway Productions",art and music

bo1iPm_eiQI,Engineering and Music: A Powerful Duet for Art and Science - Science Nation,"University of Rochester electrical engineer Mark Bocko has combined his passion for music with his passion for engineering, devising a way to digitally reproduce music in files 1,000 times smaller than an mp3! But along with this new type of compression, Bocko's team of engineers and musicians at Rochester's Eastman School of Music are also helping uncover some extraordinarily precise details about just how music is made. With support from the National Science Foundation, they have built a computer model of the clarinet, entirely from real world acoustical measurements taken from human musicians. Measuring such things as how hard the musician is blowing into the instrument and the pressure the musician applies to the reed, they have modeled the way music is made. Their work could evolve into a cool new tool for music teachers and help create more expressive, more emotional computer generated musical sounds.

ZBaPihciLdU,ART IN FUSION TV - POP ART AND POP MUSIC EXHIBITION 2018 BY JORDI CASALS,"VISIT THE AMAZING POP ART AND POP MUSIC EXHIBITION IN BORMES LES MIMOSAS _ SOUTH OF FRANCE.This exhibition , orchestrated by the  Collector Jordi Casals ,Will present from 350 to 400 items (parts,plays) of Collection representing the links between the Pop art and the Pop Music.Bormes Mimosas will pay a vibrant tribute to the artists, painters and sculptors of the “pop culture”The museum will show many rare items in “limited edition”, the main attraction being the clone sculpture of Michael Jackson “the king of pop” created by Jean-Baptiste Seckler and Adrien Saada. The walls of the museum will be covered with old issues of iconic magazines like ""Times"", ""Look"", ""Rolling Stones"", ""ParisMatch"", ""Beaux Arts"", ""Interview""...More than 200 pictures ,engraving, lithography’s , screen-printing’s and paintings from the main artists of the 60’ and 80’,like Erro, will give the beat to this very Pop exhibition.The exhibition will show the different faces, aspects of the artists who influenced and immortalized this era.The visitors will be “rocked” through the heartbeat of this singular exhibition with the music and the videos that will be played in the museum, creating this “pop” feeling.Encart : This event celebrates the 90th anniversary of Andy Warhol's birth, the 60th anniversary of Michael Jackson's birth as well as the 50th anniversary of May, 1968.P O P A R T & P O P M U S I CTwo sides of the same coinFor the first time the link between pop art and pop music will be demonstrate in the museum of arts and history of Bormes les mimosas.The exhibition evolves around three great “heroes”of the pop culture .Andy Warhol, Salvador Dali and Michael Jackson had many common points.They had their own magazines and did the cover for “Time magazine” or Playboy.These three artists are considered like kings or popes in the field of music and arts, they have their own wax statues in “le musée Grévin”,their own fragrances, stamps and they have also played in TV commercialsThe legacy that  Michael Jackson, Andy Warhol et Salvador Dali have left behind is outstanding.The museum will show during the “ Pop art & Pop music” exhibition , a huge amount of photos and pictures , like witnesses of this great heritageDali, a reference for Michael JacksonEverybody knows that Dali is the creator of self-promotion , Thanks to his unusual behavior, he was always in the center of journalists' attention, and the relations with media were the important part of the artist`s self-branding. These surrealistic happenings have inspired most of the great show business artists.So, for the first time in France the connection , the similitude and the influence that Dali had upon Jackson will be shown.Both geniuses have suffered from the same kind of curse , the feeling of being the substitute of their born dead older brother . Effectively , after the death of a previous child , Dali’s and Jackson’s parents have decided to make another one immediately , a heavy burden to carry for the young Salvador and Michael.Dali, all along his life, talked about this trauma , which led him to this constant need of being different, of being the main attraction.Michael Jackson , though performing in a different field of art , walked the same kind of path, and also had this need to be different, even from his own brothers , this need to lead his own life and career away from “the Jackson five”.FIND MORE INFORMATION ON THIS EXHIBITION AT musee@ville-bormes.frjordipictural@gmail.comAerial view by : GregPhilobates productionfilmed by ART IN FUSION TV ELVIJS PLUGIS",art and music

9RQ-Ha9JmpI,"The Harlem Renaissance:  The Rise of African American Literature, Art, and Music","This short film, produced and created by Rob Johnson of San Rafael, CA,  is an introduction to an interdisciplinary unit on the Music, Art, and Literature of the Harlem Renaissance. The Harlem Renaissance (also known as the Black Literary Renaissance and the New Negro Movement) refers to the flowering of African American cultural and intellectual life during the 1920s and 1930s. At the time, it was known as the ""New Negro Movement"", named after the 1925 anthology The New Negro edited by Alain Locke. Centered in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City, the movement impacted urban centers throughout the United States. Across the cultural spectrum (literature, drama, music, visual art, dance) and also in the realm of social thought (sociology, historiography, philosophy), artists and intellectuals found new ways to explore the historical experiences of black America and the contemporary experiences of black life in the urban North. Challenging white paternalism and racism, African-American artists and intellectuals rejected imitating the styles of Europeans and white Americans and instead celebrated black dignity and creativity. Asserting their freedom to express themselves on their own terms, they explored their identities as black Americans, celebrating the black culture that had emerged out of slavery, as well as cultural ties to Africa. The Harlem Renaissance had a profound impact not only on African-American culture but also on the cultures of the African diaspora. Afro-Caribbean artists and intellectuals from the British West Indies, who had migrated to New York in number, were part of the movement. Moreover, many French-speaking black writers from African and Caribbean colonies who lived in Paris were also influenced by the Harlem Renaissance.[1] Historians disagree as to when the Harlem Renaissance began and ended. It is unofficially recognized to have spanned from about 1919 until the early or mid 1930s. Many of its ideas lived on much longer. The zenith of this ""flowering of Negro literature"", as James Weldon Johnson preferred to call the Harlem Renaissance, is placed between 1924 (the year that Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life hosted a party for black writers where many white publishers were in attendance) and 1929 (the year of the stock market crash and the beginning of the Great Depression). In 1917 Hubert Harrison, ""The Father of Harlem Radicalism,"" founded the Liberty League and The Voice, the first organization and the first newspaper of the ""New Negro Movement"". Harrison's organization and newspaper were political, but also emphasized the arts (his newspaper had ""Poetry for the People"" and book review sections). In 1927, in the Pittsburgh Courier, Harrison challenged the notion of the renaissance. He argued that the ""Negro Literary Renaissance"" notion overlooked ""the stream of literary and artistic products which had flowed uninterruptedly from Negro writers from 1850 to the present"", and said the so-called ""renaissance"" was largely a white invention.

Riffing on similar themes during this revealing conversation, Dave and Haroon discuss the role of musicians in gallery spaces, the aesthetics of Kraftwerk and Detroit techno and the ways in which Haroon's turntable experiments reflect a broader trend in DIY DJ culture to doctor and modify records to create live loops and samples.To read more about the remix collaborations and hear both tracks, click here.To order a copy of Jellyman's remix, visit our shop.",art and music

4UdhxwEZ52s,Volkswagen Light Bus Woodstock Art and Music Fair,"After more than 50 years, the iconic ‘Light’ bus—a Volkswagen Type 2 van made world famous after its appearance at the legendary 1969 Woodstock Art and Music Fair—will ride again, thanks to help from Volkswagen of America and the greater Volkswagen community. Artist Dr. Bob Hieronimus, who painted the original Light bus, will unveil a recreation of the legendary bus this weekend at the Orange Country Transporter Organization (O.C.T.O.) Winter Meet in Long Beach, California. Volkswagen fans, auto enthusiasts and art aficionados alike can view the hand-painted art piece from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday, Feb. 16 at Long Beach Veteran’s Memorial Stadium. This will be the first public unveiling of the replica of the Woodstock icon and the premiere stop of its scheduled cross-country tour leading up to the music festival’s 50th anniversary.The eye-popping van is the result of a three-year endeavor with Hieronimus and Canadian documentarian John Wesley Chisholm to recover and recreate the van ahead of Woodstock’s milestone anniversary. “It’s a time machine that takes people to the past, through the present and to the future,” says Chisholm.Hieronimus had painted the original 1963 Standard Microbus in 1968, after an invitation from the van’s owner, who was using it to haul his band to the festival and wanted a ‘magic bus.’ It became a symbol of the Woodstock Art and Music Fair and greater generational call for peace, love and unity after a snapshot of the van by the Associated Press was widely circulated in newspapers and magazines across the country. The van even appeared in the liner of the official Woodstock album.  While the VW bus had already been a favorite among young people seeking efficient ways to travel the country, the Light van covered with Hieronimus’s phalanx of hand-painted symbols and psychedelic shapes captured a unique moment of American culture.Originally, the pair hoped to locate and restore the original ‘Light’ bus, but after a six-month search came up empty, they decided to build a replica. Thanks to a successful Kickstarter effort, the pair was able to acquire an exact model of the original ‘Light’ bus and begin a painstaking restoration process, including a six-week effort by Hieronimus and a team of five artists to recreate the original paintings from the bus.  After learning about the project, Volkswagen of America supported the search and restoration process. A team of Volkswagen fans have also helped bring the project to fruition, offering their services and jumping in to assist the duo.#Volkswagen #VWBus #LightBus➡️ Discover all new cars before anyone else!

lDnnT5l3hHk,"Camille Paglia: Art and American Culture, Essays, History, Film, Music - Speech","Camille Anna Paglia (English: /ˈpɑːliə/; born April 2, 1947) is an American academic and social critic. Paglia has been a professor at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, since 1984.Paglia is critical of the influence modern French writers have had on the humanities, claiming that universities are in the ""thrall"" of French post-structuralists;[57] that in the works of Jean Baudrillard, Jacques Derrida, Jacques Lacan and Michel Foucault, she never once found a sentence that interested her;[58] and that post-structuralism has broken the link between the word and the thing, and thus endangers the Western canon.[59] François Cusset writes that Paglia, like other major American public intellectuals after World War II, owes her broader recognition mainly to the political repercussions of polemics that first erupted on college campuses, in her case to a polemic against foreign intellectualism. He says she achieved phenomenal success when she called Foucault a ""bastard"", thereby providing (together with Alan Sokal's Social Text parody) the best evidence for Paul de Man's view that theory should be defined negatively, based on the opposition it arouses.[60] However, Paglia's assessment of French writers is not purely negative. She has called Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex (1949) ""brilliant"", and identified Jean-Paul Sartre's work as part of a high period in literature. Paglia has praised Roland Barthes' Mythologies (1957) and Gilles Deleuze's Masochism: Coldness and Cruelty (1967), while finding both men's later work flawed. Of Gaston Bachelard, who influenced Paglia, she wrote ""[his] dignified yet fluid phenomenological descriptive method seemed to me ideal for art"", adding that he was ""the last modern French writer I took seriously"".https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille...Image By Fronteiras do Pensamento [CC BY-SA 2.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...)], via Wikimedia Commons",art and music

Williams College Professor Gage McWeeny (Ph.D., English and American Literature, Princeton University) has devoted part of his career to the study of twentieth century and contemporary, experimental, or conceptual writing and art. Using Sol LeWitt's wall drawings as a connection to conceptualism in literature, McWeeny sheds light on the writings of Andy Warhol, Kenneth Goldsmith, and others.David Lang, Pulitzer Prize winning composer for the ""Little Match Girl Passion"" (2008) and co-founder of the musical group Bang on a Can, will also make similar connections between Sol LeWitt's art and his own conceptualist and modernist compositions, as well as the conceptual music of Steve Reich and Tom Johnson.This lecture took place on July 18, 2013.Sol LeWitt: A Wall Drawing Retrospective is on view through 2033.",art and music

SULLIVAN    Book Number: 74801    Product format: HardbackWith a career that spans 60 years and a fan base that spans all ages, Tony Bennett recently turned 80, and marked the milestone with a year-long creative outburst that included a chart-topping CD of duets with a diverse array of fellow superstar performers, from Streisand and Bono to Stevie Wonder and the Dixie Chicks. He starred in a sensational NBC TV special and performed in one sold-out show after another around the world. As if this were not enough, the UN named him 2007's Humanitarian Award honoree and the Smithsonian selected one of his paintings for their permanent collection.

Readers are whisked from his childhood, living above the grocery store where his father worked, to the magnificent apartment from where he now looks out over Central Park. Along the way he affords us a glimpse of his inner life.

It's an amazing installation a village of portable sculpture dwellings that double as musical instruments.  The walls literally make music. Musicians famous and not so famous perform concerts and then the public is invited to jam on the creations. Any one young and old can play! Airlift programming highlights our city's underground art and under-the-radar artists, transporting the dynamic street culture, living folk culture and growing contemporary arts scene of New Orleans to far-flung locations around the world for exhibitions, workshops, festivals, performances, and collaborative projects.Airlift also brings influential artists from abroad to participate in collaborative endeavors with local artists in our own community. We believe that collaboration between artists and across communities shares resources, empowers learning and unites disparate groups in common and powerful goals.New Orleans Airlift is an artist-driven initiative that collaborates and creates alongside the artists and communities we support.Airlift was founded in 2008 by musician and artist manager Jay Pennington and Delaney Martin, a multi-media installation artist, as a response to the unparalleled destruction of Hurricane Katrina and its devastating aftermath which left local artists, like all New Orleanians, struggling for their lives and livelihoods.Jay and Delaney recognized a need for new audiences who could support these artists as they rebuilt their city. They dreamt up a one-time project that took city artists to Berlin and called it The New Orleans Airlift after the Berlin Airlift of WWII. Other exchange projects that used an import/export model and a multidisciplinary approach soon followed and the name stuck.New Orleans is the last great bastion of living folk culture in the United states. Airlift projects honor tradition alongside innovation, leading our artists, culture and communities in meaningful new directions.Tweet -  @dannywolverton https://twitter.com/dannywolvertonI invite you to follow me on facebook and twitter: http://www.facebook.com/realspecialheadhttps://twitter.com/dannywolverton http://www.specialhead.comhttp://www.facebook.com/wolvertondanny Special Head LevitationHe is  best known for his appearances on America’s Got Talent in 2013 /2014 and subsequent viral videos of his Levitation acts. His America's Got talent performances were viewed by more than 40 million people on YouTube alone!""The popularity amongst Children across America following my viral appearances really inspired me, That I've been given an opportunity to be a good roll model for kids. Thats a great reason to wake up in morning"" -Wolverton""My artistic Vision is greatly influenced by my upbringing in the Native American Peyote Way Church and the Baha'i Faith. I realized that  1,000 years ago all art, performance, music, and dance was done through spiritual inspiration. The original performances were ritual and Ceremony. It wasn't until the Renaissance  that making a living through art became more widespread. Through my performances I intend to bring us back to an age of mysticism. Reminding people that performance is a ritual and that magic can be spiritual. The Special Head show goes beyond a traditional magic show. Not only does Wolverton perform Music while simultaneously performing magic illusions, Wolverton also incorporates thought provoking theatrics into his many acts. Danny uses illusions to cause the viewer to question ""what it means to be human."" His show is flexible and can be adapted to entertain many different age groups.The Anarchestra is set up as an interactive art installation that the public gets to play. It can be tuned all to the same key making it hard to hit the wrong notes. You don't have to be a good musician to play it.

N0u04EqNVjo,The Art of Punk - Black Flag - Art + Music - MOCAtv,"On the first episode of ""The Art of Punk"" we dissect the art of the legendary Black Flag. From the iconic four bars symbols, to the many coveted and collected gig flyers, singles, and band t-shirts, all depicting the distinctive Indian ink drawn image and text by artist Raymond Pettibon. We start off in Los Angeles talking to two founding members singer Keith Morris, and bass player Chuck Dukowski, about what the scene was like in 1976 - setting the stage for the band's formation, as well as the bands name, and the creation of the iconic four bars symbol. Raymond Pettibon talks with us from his New York art studio. Back in LA we meet with Flea, from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, about how the art, the music, and that early LA scene impacted his own life and career. To wrap it all up we sit and talk at length, with Henry Rollins, at MOCA Grand Ave in Los Angeles, about all of the above and more. Created, directed, and Executive Produced by writer/author of 'Fucked Up + Photocopied', Bryan Ray Turcotte (Kill Your Idols), and Bo Bushnell (The Western Empire), The Art Of Punk traces the roots of the punk movement and the artists behind the iconic logos of punk bands such as: Black Flag (Raymond Pettibon), The Dead Kennedys (Winston Smith), and Crass (Dave King).In addition to profiling the artists, the series includes intimate interviews with former band members, notable artists, and celebrities who have been heavily influenced by the art of punk rock including Jello Biafra, Tim Biskup, Scott Campbell, Chuck Dukowski, Flea, Steve Olson, Penny Rimbaud, Henry Rollins, Owen Thornton, and Gee Vaucher.The filmmakers Bryan Ray Turcotte and Bo Bushnell take a unique approach to exploring the rich histories of these three seminal punk legends by focusing on the influential imagery and seeking out stories that have not been told yet through the artwork, which is integral to the importance and influence of each band.On June 11, 2013 The Art Of Punk debuts on MOCAtv with an episode on Raymond Pettibon and the artwork of Black Flag. The stories behind the art of the Dead Kennedys will debut on June 18, and June 25 will see the release of the Crass episode, all of which will be available at: www.youtube.com/MOCAtvCreated By:BRYAN RAY TURCOTTEhttps://twitter.com/bryanraymond www.KillYourIdols.comBO BUSHNELLhttps://twitter.com/BoBushnellInstagram.com/BoBushnellhttp://bobushnell.comDIRECTED BY:BRYAN RAY TURCOTTEBO BUSHNELLEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS:EMMA REEVESJOHN TOBAEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS:BRYAN RAY TURCOTTEBO BUSHNELLSTARRING:RAYMOND PETTIBONKEITH MORRISCHUCK DUKOWSKIHENRY ROLLINSFLEACAMERA:JOSH WEBBERBO BUSHNELLJASON BAKEREDITED BY:TIM BROOKSBEAST EDITORIALASSISTANT EDITOR:PAUL JAROLIMEKPRONERBEAST EDITORIALLOCATION SOUND:NOAH ALEXANDERCHARLES EASTMONDMOTION GRAPHIC DESIGN:BRENT STANGELMUSIC SUPERVISION:BETA PETROLMUSIC BY:RAW NERVETHEME MUSIC:SON THE FATHER by FUCKED UPCOURTESY BEGGARS GROUPADDITIONAL MUSIC BY:C.R.A.S.H.SCANNING BY:JESSE SPEARSSOUND MIXING:PHIL LANTZM SQUARED PRODUCTIONSCOLORIST:TIM BROOKSPHOTO STILLS PROVIDED BY:BRIAN TUCKERED COLVERSPOTRYAN RICHARDSONLike MOCA on Facebook: http://bit.ly/MOCAFacebookFollow MOCA on Twitter: http://bit.ly/MOCATwitter+1 MOCA on Google+: http://bit.ly/MOCAGooglePlusLike MOCA on Facebook: http://bit.ly/MOCAFacebookFollow MOCA on Twitter: http://bit.ly/MOCATwitter+1 MOCA on Google+: http://bit.ly/MOCAGooglePlusArtIsForYou20",art and music

Alphonse Mucha and Czech Art NouveauPrague is one of the most beautiful cities of Europe and, uniquely, has remained largely unscathed by war for over three hundred years. Its fame rests upon a magnificent range of Baroque churches, palaces and public buildings embellished with art and sculpture from the eighteenth century. However, often overlooked, Prague also houses extraordinary examples of cultural works from a variety of other centuries, in particular the medieval period of the early fourteenth century and, at the other end of the time spectrum, the Art Nouveau movement.The lectures will highlight major developments in Prague’s history from its origins in the ninth century up to today, while considering representative examples of works from successive artistic periods. Throughout the lectures, relevant excerpts of Prague’s musical tradition – from religious chants and Hussite hymns to the compositions of the two towering figures of twentieth century Czech music, Smetana and Dvorak – will be introduced.http://www.summerschool.uct.ac.za/pra...DISCLAIMER: The opinions expressed in the lecture are those of the lecturer and do not necessarily reflect those of the Summer School organisers.

For creative insights, I recommend what I call creative mod. Then, when you actually create, you go into editing mode. But it's important not to mix up these two thought processes.Creativity and productivity are the two things needed to create a work of art. Many people spend forever in creative mode where new creative insights come up, but they never develop the productivity skills to bring those ideas to the world. On the other side, there are people who have created such a rigid system for creation that the editing related tasks completely nullify the ability for creative insights to come about. This process should work with many different art forms including but not limited to:DrawingPaintingSculptureWriting Video CreationAnimationDesignFilmMusicetc.",art and music

Born in Salzburg, he showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. At 17, Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court, but grew restless and traveled in search of a better position. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his death. He wrote more than 600 works, many acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral music. He is among the most enduringly popular of classical composers, and his influence is profound on subsequent Western art music. Ludwig van Beethoven composed his own early works in the shadow of Mozart, and Joseph Haydn wrote: ""Posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years"".Thank you so much for watching this video by Halidon Music channel, we hope you enjoyed it!

This discussion spills over into debates about art's value to society ---- whether access to the arts is right as basic as education or health care, and whether it should be assessed and supported by government or left to the ""invisible hand"" of the free market. President Botstein explains why it is essential to ask these questions and offers a sturdy basis for evaluating them. He goes so far as to suggest that engaging with art can give our lives meaning and purpose.

dSMiYzBEPY8,Psychosocial programs like art therapy and music therapy help heal kids faster,"Childhood cancer is a family disease in that it affects the life of patients and their parents and siblings. Cancer can also significantly impact a child's psychosocial state - their emotions, behaviors, thoughts. A child's psychosocial state also impacts his or her relationships with family, friends, peers, etc. Art therapy and music therapy are just two of the many programs our staff offers to patients with cancer. These programs help patients express their emotions in a healthy, effective way. They also serve as a distraction when things get especially difficult during treatment or in the hospital.Our therapists are nationally certified and offer the best possible care to our patients and often times engage the entire family in sessions.Learn more about our music therapy program (here: http://bit.ly/11DHCvn) and our other psychosocial services for patients and their families (here:http://bit.ly/11DHyMc)Learn more about Tammi Young-Saleme (here:http://bit.ly/11DHzji)Watch a music therapy session at Nationwide Children's here: http://bit.ly/11DHCf3",art and music

The no-holds-barred art and music festival parties on for nine straight days until September 4. About 70,000 people are expected to show up this year. Tickets are an ultra-affordable $1,200. Burning Manners also have to get to Black Rock Desert by themselves. Smoking Man is billed as a festival full of eclectic artists, off-the-wall families, high power CEO douches and tech dweebs. Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page and Mark Zuckerberg have all partied it up at Hot Man before. Wouldn't you totally want to do some lines with these guys? The Smoldering Man was first held by Larry Harvey and some pals in 1986. It's called Burning Man because it started with some hippies chanting around a bonfire on the summer solstice on Baker Beach in San Fran. Since then, it's blown up into the spectacle you see now today. At the end of the festival, all the hipsters get together and burn a giant wooden man. It's so touching — especially if you're as high as a Space-X rocket.----------------------------------------­---------------------Go to https://www.patreon.com/tomonews and become a Patron now TomoNews is now on Patreon and we've got some cool perks for our hardcore fans.TomoNews is your best source for real news.

Thank you so much to the community for the support and kind words, they mean the absolute world to me!Original music for #GeekandSundry's #CriticalRoleSO this piece took research to pull off, I'd read that Matt had based a lot of Wildemount's culture off of real life Eastern European examples and I remember hearing a while back that his favourite instrument was violin so I implemented a mix of Eastern European folk music (Polish, Hungarian, etc.) into a very rhythmic orchestral. I'd started this piece a few days prior to the first episode so the fact that they're using music from the Witcher series actually coincides quite well with this. You may have noticed but I also worked Jason Charles Miller's original main theme into the ending and a violin passage mixed in with my own theme. I'll go into a more in depth analysis if enough people want to know how this was made.",art and music

Represented musically by the violent interruption of block rocking beats, video director Andrew Thomas Huang here depicts the push and pull of tectonic plates with anthropomorphized rocks, lava and sand encircling Björk in dance, their psychedelic innards resembling the frayed strands of a Fritz Haeg rug.

tbZq8xH4ZAM,CHANEL No5 - ART GALLERY - MUSIC - YAMAHA PSR 750 + MOX,"Keyboards used are the YAMAHA MOX and YAMAHA PSR 750. How many of you remember this ad way back in the 70s, I think I had not long left school and this was one of those pieces of music that kept going round in my head. The Advertisement lasts for about 30 seconds and so the music is extremely short. I believe someone somewhere used samples from retro TV Ads and this was one of them. I have been tinkering with a new Keyboard, it's not top of the range but I think I may find the PSR 750 versatile enough for me. I have made an arrangement from this wonderful piece and have managed to make it last about 3 Minutes. I hope you like it.",art and music

YES! https://www.brainwavehub.com/binaural...▶Subscribe to the Brainwave Hub : http://www.youtube.com/user/binauralb...▶Subscribe to The Meditation Music Hub!* https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCydP...This audio, which can be used during work, study or meditation  uses alternating sequences of Beta, Alpha and Theta waves to encourage fluid and abstract creative thinking (Alpha & Theta), while at the same time maintaining a state of focus (Beta) for effective problem solving and high-level information processing. ▶SpecsFor each one hour session, the frequencies cycle through three frequency bands in 5 minute increments....Beta (12Hz) → Alpha (8-8.5hz) → Beta (13Hz) → Theta (7-7.5hz) → Beta (14hz) → Alpha (10hz) → Beta (14.5hz) → Theta (7-7.5hz) → Beta (15hz) → Alpha (10hz) → Beta (15.5hz) → Theta (7-7.5hz)This quick interplay between beta and theta/alpha promotes a balance between concrete thought and creative abstraction. This way we can encourage and bring to light new insights, generate new & original ideas, contemplate a concept from various points of view, and problem solve holistically. The beta phases serve to not only promote focus and concentration, but to also analyse, organise and therefore make sense of the abstractions derived from the more non linear holistic mind states induced by Theta and Alpha. In addition to using this audio during work or study, you can also use it in a rested state while meditating to assist with creative visualisation.  ▶TimestampsSelect an annotation on the screen, or click one of the timestamps below.Music & Isochronic Tones - 00:00 Music & Binaural Beats - 1:00:00Pure Isochronic Tones - 2:00:00Pure Binaural Beats - 3:00:00▶How do I listen?Headphones are recommended for best results. Listen at a quiet volume, or any level that you find non-intrusive. Listen during study or any task which requires focus and 'out-of-the-box' thinking. The addition of alpha and theta waves means that you can also use this session for creative visualisation, for which is a rested state is ideal.Focus and Creativity Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list... ▶To stay up to date on all of our audios, subscribe to the Brainwave Hub : http://www.youtube.com/user/binauralb... ▶Join us on Facebook & Google+ : https://www.facebook.com/binauralbrai...https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/1030415...",art and music

kfBvz2rG-NI,Nina Burmi sings Thumri | Vocal and tabla | Indian Classical Music,"#darbarfestival | Nina Burmi uses her smooth three-octave vocal range to explore the thumri style - a semi-classical genre intimately connected with dance, poetry, and drama.|*| Explore the finest Indian classical music and dance by signing up to our newsletter at: http://www.darbar.org/newsletter, and watch full length exclusive concerts in pristine HD on the Darbar Player: http://www.darbar.org/darbarplayer---------------------------------------------------------------------Learn more about the music:Thumri is a sensuous ‘light classical’ style, originating in Uttar Pradesh. The word is derived from the Hindi ‘thumakna’, meaning ‘to walk with dancing steps so as to make the ankle-bells tinkle’, and the genre remains closely connected with dance and drama. Ragas are treated more flexibly, and songs are often devotional, romantic, or even erotic in nature. Lyrics have a central role, often being based on folk tales or classical poetry, and commonly depicting the separation of lovers, or myths of Lord Krishna.Nina Burmi sings in the Kirana gharana style, tackling khayal, thumri, bhajan, and other forms. Currently living in the UK, she trained under the esteemed husband-wife pairing of Dilshad Khan and Parveen Sultana, and combines the latter’s wide vocal range with a more sparsely ornamented approach. In this song she is joined by top accompanists, with lyrics describing the tension and sorrow of a lover who is separated from Lord Krishna.Recorded for Darbar Festival 2006-Nina Burmi (vocal)-Ramesh Mishra (sarangi)-Sanju Sahai (tabla)Darbar believes in the power of Indian classical arts to stir, thrill and inspire. Through shared experiences and digital connectivity we ensure that one of the world’s finest art forms reaches the widest possible audience. Founded in 2006, we deliver premium quality live events, music education, broadcasts and online engagement through promoting artistic innovation and creative technology.

ebILIKHi9wo,Delta Heavy - White Flag (Official Video),"After the widespread success of their recent ‘Paradise Lost‘ album, Delta Heavy’s untouchable work ethic has assured this momentum is continuing. Capitalising on millions of streams worldwide across multiple platforms, their next release sees them delving into a cross-pollination of genres which yet again solidifies their position as producers who can tap into a vast, versatile soundscape.Lead single ‘White Flag’ nods to not only their flawless ingenuity, but also their ability to switch up different bpms. This is something they’re renowned for in the US; the technical ability to travel through genres translates just as well into their production as it has done in their DJ sets. Orchestrated meticulously, ‘White Flag’ juxtaposes a euphoric, incessantly infectious vocal topline with Delta Heavy’s signature thumping halftime beats, a searing bassline and surging chords. Sounding totally original, the single blends DnB with glittering Electronica resulting in the perfect follow up to ‘Ghost’, equally at home on daytime radio as well as late night DJ sets.http://vevo.ly/uNNlFq#DeltaHeavy #WhiteFlag #Vevo #FutureHouse",art and music

James Blunt - Melody (Official Music Video),"Stream it now via; https://FF003.lnk.to/MelodyMASubscribe to Lost Frequencies channel: http://bit.ly/2CwQGekAfter the success of previous releases, including the wildly fruitful melodies and raw vocals of ‘Crazy’, Lost Frequencies now announces ‘Melody’ featuring chart-topping singer-songwriter James Blunt, with an uplifting video to match.Taking adolescent troubles and hardship wrapped up with with love, excitement and music as both a release, and a tool for confidence and visibility , the video for ‘Melody’ was filmed at Lost Frequencies’s own boarding school he attended in his formative teenage years, giving an injection of relatability, hope and positivity for a visual that perfectly missors the hopeful, empassioned lyrics. On the track, Lost Frequencies pays homage to country sounds using melodic guitar strums and by twisting Blunt’s soaring vocal into a unique loop come the chorus, which flows around the rhythm like a waterfall.  The release came about after Blunt had been writing in the studio with Steve Mac (co-writer and co-producer on Ed Sheeran's ‘Shape Of You’) and Ammar Malik (co-writer of Maroon 5's ‘Moves Like Jagger’) on a song called ‘Hey, Melody.’, that Lost Frequencies then added his studio spin on for a unique release.Follow Lost Frequencies onFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/LostFrequenc...Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lostfrequen...Twitter: https://twitter.com/LFrequenciesFollow James Blunt onFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/jamesblunt/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/jamesblunt/Twitter: https://twitter.com/JamesBluntMusic video by Soulvizion http://soulvizion.comSpecial thanks to:College Mellehttps://www.collegemelle.be/site/Piano's Maenehttp://www.maene.be/",art and music

ZY6h3pKqYI0,Auditory Illusions: Hearing Lyrics Where There Are None,"Was looking for a midi for a project, but I couldn't find the one I needed. Came across a website that promised to convert MP3s to midis, so I figured I'd give it a shot. Aside from the fact that the result sounded like a piano factory exploding, I also could have sworn I heard sung lyrics in it, even though the only midi track was a piano. Not sure how the converter works, but I guess the way vocals are recreated via piano is similar enough to the real song for our brains to mentally fill in the words where there aren't any. Maybe? Pianos usually don't talk.Let me know how well you hear the lyrics, if at all, and what other songs you tried!Stuff I used:Converter- http://www.ofoct.com/audio-converter/...3D Midi visualizer- http://sourceforge.jp/projects/miditr...Midi instrument editor - http://www.synthfont.com/The midis I made from the video: https://www.mediafire.com/?cds9m6ss88...",art and music

CDhju5kuuUY,"Focus & Creativity - Creative Thinking, Visualisation & Problem Solving - Binaural Beats & Iso Tones","Focus & Creativity V.3 - Creative Thinking, Visualisation & Problem Solving - Binaural Beats & Iso Tones▶ MP3 DOWNLOAD: http://www.binauralbeatshub.com/?prod...▶ Subscribe to the Brainwave Hub : http://www.youtube.com/user/binauralb...This audio, which can be used during work, study or meditation  uses alternating sequences of Beta, Alpha and Theta waves to encourage fluid and abstract creative thinking (Alpha & Theta), while at the same time maintaining a state of focus (Beta) for effective problem solving and high-level information processing. ▶ SpecsFor each one hour session, the frequencies cycle through three frequency bands in 5 minute increments....Beta (12Hz) → Alpha (8-8.5hz) → Beta (13Hz) → Theta (7-7.5hz) → Beta (14hz) → Alpha (10hz) → Beta (14.5hz) → Theta (7-7.5hz) → Beta (15hz) → Alpha (10hz) → Beta (15.5hz) → Theta (7-7.5hz)This quick interplay between beta and theta/alpha promotes a balance between concrete thought and creative abstraction. This way we can encourage and bring to light new insights, generate new & original ideas, contemplate a concept from various points of view, and problem solve holistically. The beta phases serve to not only promote focus and concentration, but to also analyse, organise and therefore make sense of the abstractions derived from the more non linear holistic mind states induced by Theta and Alpha. In addition to using this audio during work or study, you can also use it in a rested state while meditating to assist with creative visualisation.  ▶TimestampsSelect an annotation on the screen, or click one of the timestamps below.Music & Isochronic Tones - 00:00 Music & Binaural Beats - 1:00:00Pure Isochronic Tones - 2:00:00Pure Binaural Beats - 3:00:00▶How do I listen?Headphones are recommended for best results. Listen at a quiet volume, or any level that you find non-intrusive. Listen during study or any task which requires focus and 'out-of-the-box' thinking. The addition of alpha and theta waves means that you can also use this session for creative visualisation, for which is a rested state is ideal. ▶To stay up to date on all of our audios, subscribe to the Brainwave Hub : http://www.youtube.com/user/binauralb... ▶ Focus & Creativity playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list... ▶Join us on Facebook & Google+ : https://www.facebook.com/binauralbrai...https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/1030415...",art and music

You can then show that you have rights to use the music should you receive a copyright claim or if you plan to monetize your channel as a YouTube partner. This is very important, as it will prevent any possible strikes against your YouTube channel or videos.- Doesn't royalty-free music mean I can use it for free?'Royalty-free' music is not the same as 'free music'. This is a common misconception on the Internet, and especially here on YouTube.Simply put, it means that royalties don't have to be paid to the creator each and every time it's used (ie. free of royalties); but instead, a one-time fixed fee is paid, which is via a license purchase. You can read further into what ""royalty-free music"" means here: http://www.premiumbeat.com/blog/what-...- Can't I just give you credit in my videos, instead of buying a license?Unfortunately, no. Just giving credit to us in your videos doesn't protect you from copyright infringement in accordance to international law. A license is required to show YouTube that you have the proper rights to use our music on your videos, which is also needed if you're looking to become a YouTube partner and monetize your videos.- The license is shown in US Dollars, but I live outside of the US?You can purchase the license in your local currency, as this is converted to the equivalent amount during the payment process.",art and music

k7ngnWJ6Hks,Music is a visual art | Hunter Ewen | TEDxBoulder,"This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. We can use visuals to better describe music. Hunter Ewen is a dramatic music composer, educator, and multimedia designer. During the day, Dr. Ewen teaches strategies for digital creativity at the University of Colorado, the children’s collaborative art center Reel Kids, the City of Longmont, and as an independent educator. At night, he composes, solders, choreographs, and directs interdisciplinary projects around the world. Experimental performance practices and unusual notation figure prominently in Ewen’s works. A believer that compositions should be both seen and heard, his music looks as strange as it sounds. Swirles, squiggles, arrows, and fangs often replace traditional notes and rests. His aesthetic preferences gravitate towards yowls and yips and wails and squeals. Towards screams that masquerade as art. Towards clamor and deviance. Ewen’s music swings from chandeliers.About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",art and music

daVaEoF5Hrk,Arnold Schönberg - Wassily Kandinsky: Music and Art Get One,"The early years of the 20th Century signed a terrific advance in the Physical Sciences. The Special (1905) and General (1916)  Theories of Relativity and the advent of Quantum Mechanics (1926) changed our lives profoundly. Around the same years, a similar revolution took place in both Music and Art. The year 1909 marks a decisive break with tonality (the structure of classical music) by Arnold Schönberg in his ""Three Piano Pieces"". The term 'Atonality' is commonly used to express this new type of composition. Wassily Kandinsky is credited with painting the first 'purely abstract' works. His production is vast and I could only include 20 of his works here, selected from a period of time that overlaps with the musical pieces by Schönberg presented in this video. They knew each other and have possibly influenced their works reciprocally. The video is an attempt to evince this intriguing 'connection' between music and painting.About Arnold Schönberg (1874-1951):...The final piece (of the Three Piano Pieces, Op.11) breaks through all constraints of traditional language or structure, cutting abruptly from extremes of eruptive power, as in the massively congested opening, to the most intense introspection. Perhaps Schoenberg had in mind Kandinsky, with whom he had close  contacts, when he likened such music to developments in painting -""without architecture... an ever-changing, unbroken succession of colours, rhythms and moods."" (From a Text by Peter Hill).About Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944):...As the ""Der Blaue Reiter""(*) Almanac essays and theorizing with composer Arnold Schönberg indicate, Kandinsky also expressed the communion between artist and viewer as being available to both the senses and the mind (Synesthesia). Hearing tones and chords as he painted, Kandinsky theorized that, for instance, yellow is the colour of middle C on a brassy trumpet; black is the colour of closure, and the end of things; and that combinations of colours produce vibrational frequencies, akin to chords played on a piano. Kandinsky also developed a theory of geometric figures and their relationships, claiming, for example, that the circle is the most peaceful shape and represents the human soul.

Day For Night is currently the only confirmed U.S. date for New Order.Passes to the two day art and music festival will be available at 10AM on Thursday, October 8, via www.dayfornight.io. Two ticket levels will be made available. General Admission will give access to the art installations as well as all musical performances on three stages for the entire weekend at a price of $185. VIP tickets are limited and will include front of stage pit access with private bar, complimentary beverages and small plates, access to private lounge, rapid entry, and commemorative lanyard for $750. Thousands of blind pre-sale tickets sold out in less than 24 hours when the event was announced in early September. Curator Alex Czetwertynski explains, “The festival's title, “Day For Night,” provides the main key to understand the work being presented, as that space between day/night or light/dark is where our perception gets the blurriest. All of the artists in our roster will, in one way or another, transform our feeling of time, space, perspective, and place. They were chosen because of their common use of computational media to manipulate light, time, and sound. Their approaches to light and sound can be literal, or purely as a medium to reveal content.  And with the large scale canvas that Day for Night is offering these artists, we can only expect this audio-visual exchange to be a heightened sensorial experience.”With acres of immersive installations within the emerging field of digital art and performances by world-class musicians, each are curated not just for their musical talent but also the visual qualities of their stage presence, Day For Night seeks to redefine the festival experience and inspire attendees to re-examine the way they interact with and understand both art and music.",art and music

Apparently music and art is part of the way we communicate and it's certainly the way you attract mates. I'll just put it to you that way. Musicians and artists engage other people in a way that people who don't use music and don't use art do not. Now, there's a lot of talk about songbirds in evolutionary biology and they all have these songs, which must be pleasing to the ears of their potential mates and also must send messages to others of their species, so I guess to other species as well. I am angry; this is my territory; I'm looking for a mate; it's a sunny day. These sort of announcements are made by other species so you figure humans have just taken it just a whole other level with albums and record release parties and art exhibits and art museums and art galleries. So it really is deep within us and I think art enriches our lives, engages our brains and stimulates us in a way that nothing else we do does. So, this is only speculation on my part but music especially certainly inspires us. That's for sure. So carry on Michael. Turn it up loud.",art and music

Soq4M_hu-Nc,Aboriginal Art and Music,"A quick look at some aboriginal art .. All images taken from google images . The audio is from something called Songs From The Northern Territory 4Songs From the Northern Territory 4: Aboriginal Music From North-Eastern Arnhem Land Including Groote Eylandt Artist/Collector: Alice Moyle Label Information: Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS): AIAS 4 CD Media Type: CD Year: Recorded 1963; Released 1997 Availability: AIATSIS Notes: For the purpose of music description, Eastern Arnhem Land of the Northern Territory is divided here as follows: the north-eastern sector including offshore islands; the eastern sector, extending along the coast as far south as the Roper River; and the Groote Eylandt archipelago north-west of the Gulf of Carpentaria. Field recordings reproduced on this compact disc were collected at Milingimbi and Yirrkala in the north-eastern sector and at Angurugu and Umbakumba on Groote Eylandt. The Aboriginal communities at Milingimbi and Yirrkala, together with the people at Galiwin'ku (previously known as Elcho Island) have been referred to in the anthropological literature as the Murngin (WL Warner) and Wulamba (RM Berndt). More recently, they have become known as the Yolngu, from a local word meaning 'people'. The people on Groote Eylandt were known by mainland groups as the Wayingurra and their language, Ingurra. In the absence of a name for the Groote Eylandters, Warnindilyakwa, a name formerly given to one of the larger clans on the island, is sometimes used. Anindilyakwa is the name of the island language. Item characteristics of Eastern Arnhem Land clan songs performed and recorded in the 1960s-all of which were sung by men-are summarised here as follows: (1) a didjeridu accompaniment which utilises two tones differing widely in pitch (the interval between the higher or overblown tone and the fundamental often sounding close to a tenth but varying according to the shape and length of the hollowed branch); (2) a narrow vocal range of pitch (compare them, for instance, with Western Arnhem Land songs) which rarely exceeds a fifth or sixth and may be less than a second; (3) song words which are translatable, meaningful and appropriate to relevant clan territories and related myths; and (4) the occurrence of an unaccompanied vocal termination (UVT), or termination of a song item by voice or voices alone after the accompanying instruments have ceased. Good examples of this fourth item characteristic are to be heard on this disc (Track 1) and disc 3 (Track 11). Song refrains may consist of repeated strings of words and syllables, a prolonged single syllable or a repeated pattern of vocal sounds (for example, bird calls). These calls are incorporated into the particular sectional or phraselike structure of many item sequences performed in Eastern Arnhem Land. On Groote Eylandt (tracks 7-13), only the first three of the above characteristics are to be heard. There is no occurrence of the UVT in these items but the following additional characteristics distinguish emeba (Groote Eylandt clan songs) from manikay (north-eastern Arnhem Land clan songs): a. the shaky voice, a deliberate manner of vocal ornamentation used by some emeba singers; b. the break or brief cessation of the vocal part of a Groote Eylandt clan song which is signalled by certain words the singer chooses to sing (the song subject at this point may fall, swoop down, or change abruptly in some way-it was said that the break gives the singer time to decide which words to sing next); c. a short, patterned interplay between sticks and didjeridu during the break; and d. the general clatter of stick-beating percussion arising from several different sources at the same time. Further comparison of emeba and manikay reveals that, whereas the durations of the latter are usually about one minute or less, emeba items may last for more than two minutes each.Manikay.comIt is such a shame that so much aboriginal culture has been lost .. Its good to see that some remains .",art and music

Stay focused!Arguably, all music can be said to be useful for Meditation. The styles, cadences, arpeggiations, and rhythms of meditational music for contemplative practices is characteristically different than most other forms of music. Generally speaking, the music is relaxing, lacking definitive rhythms. Meditation and music have been relational partners for centuries. Mellow, repetitive, and redundant sequences of smoothly contoured melodic lines help to relax the mind as arrhythmic tempos do not distract the listener into a beat but rather a flow. Harmonies are often absent unless one accepts the musical nuance of imitation as structured harmony. Meditation music can also include recordings of sounds in the ""natural"" world: rainfall, waterfalls, birds, insects, whales, and others, separately and in synthetic combination.In the recent years, it was scientifically proven that relaxing art techniques combined with music is one of the best ways forward as it guarantees rapid positive results. So, our main goal is to share this relaxation method with you all.Music Art Meditation - Experience the Whole New Meditation Technique Using Music and Art!👍 Like 💬Comment ✅Share and ❤️Subscribe: Click on the Bell 🔔 to be Notified First to View 👀 the Videos!© MusicArtMeditation - MaM© #MusicArtMeditation-----------------------------------------------------Music Credits:""Tristan Lohengrin - The End Of The World"" is under a Creative Commons license (CC BY 3.0).Music promoted by BreakingCopyright: https://youtu.be/vp2xrvXh9M0-----------------------------------------------------",art and music

jvYTiPQAyAE,How art and music create a new hybrid global culture: Rajae El Mouhandiz at TEDxBreda,"The ""one story"" of Muslims and immigrants we hear in the news and politics every day is ignoring the many stories of millions of women and men who do not see themselves in that old story, but as authors and owners of a new story where globalism and hybrid cultures are the stage and vehicle. They represent a new story of being and belonging in the world. A story where history is honoured as the sacrifices of those who came before us. Their parents moved to the west to start something new, mixed with the old, and individuals like Rajae El Mouhandiz are the product. As the new stories they are shaping do not yet have a language and a platform, one has to start telling the stories through art and music. And personal strength.Regarding Rajae El MouhandizRajae El Mouhandiz is a Dutch-Moroccan-Algerian poet, singer, composer, producer, and founder of the record label Truthseeker Records. After leaving her family at age 15 and being the first Moroccan to study at a Dutch conservatory at age 16. El Mouhandiz left classical music at age 20 to follow her own artistic path, seeking to incorporate her cultural roots. She started her own record label at age 25, released two albums and is currently developing her third album in Morocco. On international women's day 2013 El Mouhandiz premiered her first short documentary film, about the acceptance of Muslim women in mainstream media and the music industry. Currently she is developing her second short film, focusing on her Maghreb heritage and the story of her grandfathers. She is also one of the 60 female curators of the groundbreaking international MUSLIMA exhibition, held in The USA, The Philipines, The U.A.E and Denmark. And together with the British Council Ireland and a Dutch theatre production company, El Mouhandiz is producing the Dutch and European version of the Hijabi Monologues; a theatre space for the experiences of Muslim women; a space to breathe as they are; a space that does not claim to tell every story and speak for every voice. The Dutch premiere is planned in September 2014. Rajae was nominated as Muslim Leader of tomorrow in 2005. She was nominated by Elsevier magazine as one of Hollands' 10 biggest talents in 2007, in the field of contemporary music and from 2009 -- 2012 she was the only female contemporary artist to be nominated on the list of the 500 most influential Muslims in the world. This year Rajae has been nominated for the 5th year in a row. More information: www.rajae.net",art and music

When I am faced with the whiteness of my creative page, I like to set limiting parameters before I begin my work. Choosing to limit my creative output can bring focus and direction. The following are a few examples of the concept of limitation:1. Georgia O'Keeffe uses soft and wavy curves in her paintings (example: Flower of Life II)2. Claude Debussy focuses on the pentatonic and the octatonic scales in his compositions.3. The game of chess limits the movements of the pieces both collectively and individually.Join me for more talks about art, inspiration, and all things creative.This episode features the music from my album Lacrimosa: http://www.dosiamckay.com/lacrimosa.s...My website: http://dosiamckay.com/My compositions: http://www.dosiamckay.com/recordings....My paintings: http://www.dosiamckay.com/art/gallery...My writing and poetry: https://musicwell.wordpress.com/Follow meFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dosiamckay/Twitter: https://twitter.com/dosiamckayGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+DosiaMcKayYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/dosiamckay",art and music

Dmitri will begin by describing the deep similarities between the languages of music and geometry, showing how elementary musical terms like “chord” and “voice leading” correspond to geometrical concepts like “vectors in an orbifold.” This correspondence in turn allows us to appreciate the hidden logic of particular pieces, the development of styles, and entire genres. Nathan will continue by showing how mathematical ideas can underwrite visually and conceptually striking visual art. The speakers will then join forces to describe some of the challenges and opportunities of using these ideas in creating a multimedia performance.Nathan Selikoff plays with interactivity and motion in time and space. Inspired by the behavior of systems, science, nature, and music, he combines computer code, traditional materials, and future technology to bring new ideas to life.

She is currently a feature writer and radio critic for The Observer, and is a regular arts critic in print and on television and radio. Miranda is also on the board of Tate Members.Haroon Mirza is a British artist who combines a variety of readymade and time based material to create audio compositions, which are often realised as site-specific installations. In doing so, Mirza complicates the distinctions between noise, sound and music, and alters the function and meaning of everyday objects and and socio-cultural constructs.Adrian Shaw is part of Tate’s Learning department, working on the Young People’s Programme. He has been organising music events since the early 1990’s and introduced large scale music programming to Tate over 10 years ago.  Now established as ‘Late at Tate’, these events often explore the boundaries between music, performance and art.  Adrian is also a musician, and one half of the arts duo boyleANDshaw.Will Skeaping is a creative consultant and music producer. Following a tour of duty at Google, he worked closely with rappers, authors and film makers as label manager at Lex Records, focusing on collaborations between artists and musicians.

XCRbISUfU2Y,Convergence 2016: Electronic Music + Visual Art,"When it comes to Electronic Music + Visual Art, we have entered into a post-instrument era in which music and visual art born of technology produce contemporary, dynamic and convergent new forms. Traditional apparatus and techniques are displaced by computer based processes, virtual instruments, electronic hardware and custom machines, stems, patches, waveforms and midi. This inaugural residency welcomes artists working in rhythmic and experimental electronic music realms, digital visual artists, and those pursuing work that creates synergies between sound, music and art.This Banff Centre residency provided the context for artists to research, conceive, prototype and present new artistic works, tools, techniques and perspectives for electronic music, sound, and visual creation. Under the artistic direction of Patti Schmidt and Jen Mizuik, and led by faculty Robin Fox and Uwe Schmidt with guest faculty who are specialists in their fields, the program offered sessions and workshops on modular synthesizers, electronic music software and hardware, visual creation software and methods, artistic process and philosophy, and the nature of live performance in these technologically dominated fields. Together artists, peers, and world-renowned faculty exchanged knowledge, discussed ideas, experimented with processes, created, collaborated, performed, and shared artistic experiences.Artists presented their works-in-progress throughout the program. The nature of the practices involved determined the presentation format and ranged from live performances, informal presentations, installations, talks and workshops. Artists received technical and artistic guidance during the development of their projects and research.

The Theta / Beta frequencies range from 6-7hz & 13-15hz respectively, with 8-12hz alpha waves interspersed throughout. The patterns switch in the following manner, every 5 minutes: 0-5 mins - Alpha / Beta; 5-10 mins - Theta / Alpha; 10 - 15 mins -Alpha / Beta; etc. etc.  up to one hour. This quick interplay between beta and theta/alpha promotes a balance between concrete thought and creative abstraction. This way we can encourage and bring to light new insights, generate new & original ideas, contemplate a concept from various points of view, and problem solve holistically. The beta phases serve to not only promote focus and concentration, but to also analyse, organise and therefore make sense of the abstractions derived from the more non linear holistic mind states induced by Theta and Alpha. In addition to using this audio during work or study, you can also use it in a rested state while meditating to assist with creative visualisation. As binaural beats have been integrated into this track, we recommend using headphones. Subscribe to The Brainwave Hub for the best brainwave entrainment audios, as well as our partner channel, The Meditation Music Hub: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCydP...--The Brainwave Hub offers high quality binaural beats and isochronic tones.

SDmdsuGr3KQ,Katawa Shoujo Beta - Shizune Act 3 (Full Art and Music),"Here is Shizune's Act 3. The official Steam forum dedicated to repairing the beta routes did not completely finish giving Shizune's route art and music direction, so I fixed it up myself. Knowing how to mod has never generated so many feels.This is a playthrough of Shizune's Act 3 in the Beta of Katawa Shoujo. Act 1 was skipped due to it being exactly the same aside from the music and some grammar errors. Act 2 has been uploaded at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4z3Rmw... I will upload Act 4 at some point in time, but I figured I should at least upload something pertaining to the beta route as of now instead of holding off everything.I decided to keep the beta music in, but upon my insertion of art and music I put in some of the final version's music instead. The beta music just seems to fit the majority of the story in this route much better.I came across a rather disturbing, yet slightly expected option in the beta that was either omitted or never finished. As it turns out, you could end up having sex with Misha at Shizune's house. During the scene where Misha confesses her love for Shizune, there was going to be a decision at some point in the conversation where you could choose to comfort her or refuse. If you do not comfort her, she tells you that she had a selfish thought that you would (this is shown at about 1:23:34 in the video) This effects multiple scenes, the most notable one being that Hisao and Misha agree to never tell Shizune about the affair. This in turn would not actually effect the story at all, but feelings of utter guilt would be inserted throughout many scenes. The most ridiculous part is that you could still get a good ending with Shizune, even after cheating on her, but I'll get into more detail about that once Act 4 comes along. For now, I will hold off the spoilers.Katawa Shoujo is a bishoujo-style visual novel set in the fictional Yamaku High School for disabled children, located somewhere in modern Japan. Hisao Nakai, a normal boy living a normal life, has his life turned upside down when a congenital heart defect forces him to move to a new school after a long hospitalization. Despite his difficulties, Hisao is able to find friends—and perhaps love, if he plays his cards right. There are five main paths corresponding to the 5 main female characters, each path following the storyline pertaining to that character. This is the beta.",art and music

d8VA7_qSC7U,With One Voice in Montreal: Art and Music Helping Homeless People.,"""Art to me is a humanitarian act and I believe that there is a responsibility that art should somehow be able to effect mankind, to make the world a better place.""  ~ Jeff KoonsSomething I don't talk about very often is that at its very core Invisible People is art. Years ago, my boss at the time had in his office a coffee table book of photos of homeless people. The pictures humanized homeless men, woman, and families as the real people that they are. I said to myself: ""I could do this with video."" Shortly after, I was laid off and Invisible People was started. If you'd like to learn more about my story and how Invisible People started, please watch this documentary https://youtu.be/z0wDn9SAWZsArt and music have the power to bring people together and change our world for the better. Both art and music can play a huge role in giving homeless people a purpose. Yes, housing ends homelessness but just putting homeless people in boxes will never end homelessness. People need to thrive and not just survive. Art therapy and music therapy are powerful tools for wellness, and as you'll see in this vlog - art, music, and theater can be used for advocacy to help change policy. Last year, With One Voice sent a delegation to the ATSA État d'Urgence Festival in Montreal, Canada. It was an amazing few days meeting new friends and brainstorming on how we can help other creative organizations scale to have more impact helping homeless people. I shot a bunch of footage but never got around to editing it into something until this month. My dream is someday to be able to produce mini-documentaries like this vlog highlighting cool ideas and amazing people working to end homelessness who may not always get a lot of media attention.  For example, in this vlog, I reference a video I shot when I was invited to the Dallas Public Library that you can watch here: https://youtu.be/_SaG0xR7xkU The folks behind With One Voice saw this video and invited Jo and Heather to Montreal to share about creating safe spaces. I hope to one day be able to produce more like this but on a much larger scale! In her interview, Beth Knowles from the City of Manchester and With One Voice references the North America Review of Arts and Homelessness that you can find here: http://with-one-voice.com/north-ameri...From With One Voice's website: With One Voice began as a showcase event curated by Streetwise Opera at the 2012 Cultural Olympiad in London. For the first time in Olympic history, it gave a platform for homeless people – celebrating the artistic achievements of 300 performers who had experienced homelessness.To learn more about the people and the organizations in this video, here is a link to information about the delegates https://www.atsa.qc.ca/en/eu-2017-wit...

One story at a time, videos posted on InvisiblePeople.tv shatter the stereotypes of America’s homeless, force shifts in perception and deliver a call to action that is being answered by national brands, nonprofit organizations and everyday citizens now committed to opening their eyes and their hearts to those too often forgotten.Invisible People is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to changing the way we think about people experiencing homelessness.",art and music

AV6IQ55GZ_0,"Connecting Geometric Form of Art, Architecture, and Music","This research investigates the history of various art forms of religious structures from both Muslim and Catholic Empires of the Iberian Peninsula throughout the end of the Middle Ages in Spain. By investigating the fundamental geometric forms of both Islamic art and Gothic architecture, there is a connection between religious influence, visual creativity and architectural  structure that strengthens physical capacity to the human experience. Relating these two art forms to music theory provides an introduction to the progress of music sciences in the modern age; including Cymatics, a 20th century science of wave phenomenon that demonstrates various geometric shapes of frequencies and musical pitch. This interdisciplinary approach of visualizing the common geometric forms of art, architecture, and music questions the anticipatory influence and outlook of the arts for future generations.",art and music

WJaR7rJqKIk,"Art and Incarceration:  Poetry, Theatre and Music in and about Captivity","For this interdisciplinary performance, Ensemble Pi presented music, text, and theater works that focus on the rise of mass incarceration, the racial disparities it reveals, and the emotional toll it takes on inmates and their families. The evening started with the world premiere of Rikers Island by New York composer Eleanor Cory, inspired by the anthology These Are Hard Times for Dreamers. Followed by Rzewski’s minimalist masterpiece, Coming Together, composed in the wake of the 1971 prison riots in upstate New York and powerfully expressing the frustration of life behind bars and anger about injustice. Joseph Assadourian, the narrator for Coming Together, will also perform an excerpt from his tragi-comic play, The Bullpen, based on his own incarceration. The performance closed with the sublime Olivier Messiaen’s Quartet for the End of Time (1941), composed and performed in the prisoner-of-war camp in Gorlitz, Germany, capturing the hardship and sadness of being in prison, while still conveying optimism.About the presenters:Ensemble Pi is a new music collective that uniquely connects pressing social and political issues and the idioms of classical contemporary music. They began a Peace Concerts series 10 years ago in response to the invasion of Iraq, and have since presented annual chamber music concerts giving voice to the struggle for peace. Every concert includes at least one commission, as well as contemporary classical masterpieces to address the historical tradition of “socially conscious” compositions. In the past, the group has collaborated with visual artists, writers, journalists and actors – including South African artist William Kentridge and American journalists Naomi Wolf and Jeremy Scahill – and have featured the music of John Harbison, Frederic Rzewski, Shostakovich and Penderecki. The Peace Concerts series has also protested the censorship of media, fracking, the Apartheid, and more. Performers include: Alexis Gerlach, cello; Moran Katz, clarinet; Idith Meshulam Korman, piano; Airi Yoshioka, violin; and Joseph Assadourian, actor and narrator. The group is joined by local Houston musicians Craig Hauschildt, percussion and Daniel Egan, trumpet.c Rothko Chapel/Runaway Productions",art and music

bo1iPm_eiQI,Engineering and Music: A Powerful Duet for Art and Science - Science Nation,"University of Rochester electrical engineer Mark Bocko has combined his passion for music with his passion for engineering, devising a way to digitally reproduce music in files 1,000 times smaller than an mp3! But along with this new type of compression, Bocko's team of engineers and musicians at Rochester's Eastman School of Music are also helping uncover some extraordinarily precise details about just how music is made. With support from the National Science Foundation, they have built a computer model of the clarinet, entirely from real world acoustical measurements taken from human musicians. Measuring such things as how hard the musician is blowing into the instrument and the pressure the musician applies to the reed, they have modeled the way music is made. Their work could evolve into a cool new tool for music teachers and help create more expressive, more emotional computer generated musical sounds.

ZBaPihciLdU,ART IN FUSION TV - POP ART AND POP MUSIC EXHIBITION 2018 BY JORDI CASALS,"VISIT THE AMAZING POP ART AND POP MUSIC EXHIBITION IN BORMES LES MIMOSAS _ SOUTH OF FRANCE.This exhibition , orchestrated by the  Collector Jordi Casals ,Will present from 350 to 400 items (parts,plays) of Collection representing the links between the Pop art and the Pop Music.Bormes Mimosas will pay a vibrant tribute to the artists, painters and sculptors of the “pop culture”The museum will show many rare items in “limited edition”, the main attraction being the clone sculpture of Michael Jackson “the king of pop” created by Jean-Baptiste Seckler and Adrien Saada. The walls of the museum will be covered with old issues of iconic magazines like ""Times"", ""Look"", ""Rolling Stones"", ""ParisMatch"", ""Beaux Arts"", ""Interview""...More than 200 pictures ,engraving, lithography’s , screen-printing’s and paintings from the main artists of the 60’ and 80’,like Erro, will give the beat to this very Pop exhibition.The exhibition will show the different faces, aspects of the artists who influenced and immortalized this era.The visitors will be “rocked” through the heartbeat of this singular exhibition with the music and the videos that will be played in the museum, creating this “pop” feeling.Encart : This event celebrates the 90th anniversary of Andy Warhol's birth, the 60th anniversary of Michael Jackson's birth as well as the 50th anniversary of May, 1968.P O P A R T & P O P M U S I CTwo sides of the same coinFor the first time the link between pop art and pop music will be demonstrate in the museum of arts and history of Bormes les mimosas.The exhibition evolves around three great “heroes”of the pop culture .Andy Warhol, Salvador Dali and Michael Jackson had many common points.They had their own magazines and did the cover for “Time magazine” or Playboy.These three artists are considered like kings or popes in the field of music and arts, they have their own wax statues in “le musée Grévin”,their own fragrances, stamps and they have also played in TV commercialsThe legacy that  Michael Jackson, Andy Warhol et Salvador Dali have left behind is outstanding.The museum will show during the “ Pop art & Pop music” exhibition , a huge amount of photos and pictures , like witnesses of this great heritageDali, a reference for Michael JacksonEverybody knows that Dali is the creator of self-promotion , Thanks to his unusual behavior, he was always in the center of journalists' attention, and the relations with media were the important part of the artist`s self-branding. These surrealistic happenings have inspired most of the great show business artists.So, for the first time in France the connection , the similitude and the influence that Dali had upon Jackson will be shown.Both geniuses have suffered from the same kind of curse , the feeling of being the substitute of their born dead older brother . Effectively , after the death of a previous child , Dali’s and Jackson’s parents have decided to make another one immediately , a heavy burden to carry for the young Salvador and Michael.Dali, all along his life, talked about this trauma , which led him to this constant need of being different, of being the main attraction.Michael Jackson , though performing in a different field of art , walked the same kind of path, and also had this need to be different, even from his own brothers , this need to lead his own life and career away from “the Jackson five”.FIND MORE INFORMATION ON THIS EXHIBITION AT musee@ville-bormes.frjordipictural@gmail.comAerial view by : GregPhilobates productionfilmed by ART IN FUSION TV ELVIJS PLUGIS",art and music

9RQ-Ha9JmpI,"The Harlem Renaissance:  The Rise of African American Literature, Art, and Music","This short film, produced and created by Rob Johnson of San Rafael, CA,  is an introduction to an interdisciplinary unit on the Music, Art, and Literature of the Harlem Renaissance. The Harlem Renaissance (also known as the Black Literary Renaissance and the New Negro Movement) refers to the flowering of African American cultural and intellectual life during the 1920s and 1930s. At the time, it was known as the ""New Negro Movement"", named after the 1925 anthology The New Negro edited by Alain Locke. Centered in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City, the movement impacted urban centers throughout the United States. Across the cultural spectrum (literature, drama, music, visual art, dance) and also in the realm of social thought (sociology, historiography, philosophy), artists and intellectuals found new ways to explore the historical experiences of black America and the contemporary experiences of black life in the urban North. Challenging white paternalism and racism, African-American artists and intellectuals rejected imitating the styles of Europeans and white Americans and instead celebrated black dignity and creativity. Asserting their freedom to express themselves on their own terms, they explored their identities as black Americans, celebrating the black culture that had emerged out of slavery, as well as cultural ties to Africa. The Harlem Renaissance had a profound impact not only on African-American culture but also on the cultures of the African diaspora. Afro-Caribbean artists and intellectuals from the British West Indies, who had migrated to New York in number, were part of the movement. Moreover, many French-speaking black writers from African and Caribbean colonies who lived in Paris were also influenced by the Harlem Renaissance.[1] Historians disagree as to when the Harlem Renaissance began and ended. It is unofficially recognized to have spanned from about 1919 until the early or mid 1930s. Many of its ideas lived on much longer. The zenith of this ""flowering of Negro literature"", as James Weldon Johnson preferred to call the Harlem Renaissance, is placed between 1924 (the year that Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life hosted a party for black writers where many white publishers were in attendance) and 1929 (the year of the stock market crash and the beginning of the Great Depression). In 1917 Hubert Harrison, ""The Father of Harlem Radicalism,"" founded the Liberty League and The Voice, the first organization and the first newspaper of the ""New Negro Movement"". Harrison's organization and newspaper were political, but also emphasized the arts (his newspaper had ""Poetry for the People"" and book review sections). In 1927, in the Pittsburgh Courier, Harrison challenged the notion of the renaissance. He argued that the ""Negro Literary Renaissance"" notion overlooked ""the stream of literary and artistic products which had flowed uninterruptedly from Negro writers from 1850 to the present"", and said the so-called ""renaissance"" was largely a white invention.

Riffing on similar themes during this revealing conversation, Dave and Haroon discuss the role of musicians in gallery spaces, the aesthetics of Kraftwerk and Detroit techno and the ways in which Haroon's turntable experiments reflect a broader trend in DIY DJ culture to doctor and modify records to create live loops and samples.To read more about the remix collaborations and hear both tracks, click here.To order a copy of Jellyman's remix, visit our shop.",art and music

4UdhxwEZ52s,Volkswagen Light Bus Woodstock Art and Music Fair,"After more than 50 years, the iconic ‘Light’ bus—a Volkswagen Type 2 van made world famous after its appearance at the legendary 1969 Woodstock Art and Music Fair—will ride again, thanks to help from Volkswagen of America and the greater Volkswagen community. Artist Dr. Bob Hieronimus, who painted the original Light bus, will unveil a recreation of the legendary bus this weekend at the Orange Country Transporter Organization (O.C.T.O.) Winter Meet in Long Beach, California. Volkswagen fans, auto enthusiasts and art aficionados alike can view the hand-painted art piece from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday, Feb. 16 at Long Beach Veteran’s Memorial Stadium. This will be the first public unveiling of the replica of the Woodstock icon and the premiere stop of its scheduled cross-country tour leading up to the music festival’s 50th anniversary.The eye-popping van is the result of a three-year endeavor with Hieronimus and Canadian documentarian John Wesley Chisholm to recover and recreate the van ahead of Woodstock’s milestone anniversary. “It’s a time machine that takes people to the past, through the present and to the future,” says Chisholm.Hieronimus had painted the original 1963 Standard Microbus in 1968, after an invitation from the van’s owner, who was using it to haul his band to the festival and wanted a ‘magic bus.’ It became a symbol of the Woodstock Art and Music Fair and greater generational call for peace, love and unity after a snapshot of the van by the Associated Press was widely circulated in newspapers and magazines across the country. The van even appeared in the liner of the official Woodstock album.  While the VW bus had already been a favorite among young people seeking efficient ways to travel the country, the Light van covered with Hieronimus’s phalanx of hand-painted symbols and psychedelic shapes captured a unique moment of American culture.Originally, the pair hoped to locate and restore the original ‘Light’ bus, but after a six-month search came up empty, they decided to build a replica. Thanks to a successful Kickstarter effort, the pair was able to acquire an exact model of the original ‘Light’ bus and begin a painstaking restoration process, including a six-week effort by Hieronimus and a team of five artists to recreate the original paintings from the bus.  After learning about the project, Volkswagen of America supported the search and restoration process. A team of Volkswagen fans have also helped bring the project to fruition, offering their services and jumping in to assist the duo.#Volkswagen #VWBus #LightBus➡️ Discover all new cars before anyone else!

lDnnT5l3hHk,"Camille Paglia: Art and American Culture, Essays, History, Film, Music - Speech","Camille Anna Paglia (English: /ˈpɑːliə/; born April 2, 1947) is an American academic and social critic. Paglia has been a professor at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, since 1984.Paglia is critical of the influence modern French writers have had on the humanities, claiming that universities are in the ""thrall"" of French post-structuralists;[57] that in the works of Jean Baudrillard, Jacques Derrida, Jacques Lacan and Michel Foucault, she never once found a sentence that interested her;[58] and that post-structuralism has broken the link between the word and the thing, and thus endangers the Western canon.[59] François Cusset writes that Paglia, like other major American public intellectuals after World War II, owes her broader recognition mainly to the political repercussions of polemics that first erupted on college campuses, in her case to a polemic against foreign intellectualism. He says she achieved phenomenal success when she called Foucault a ""bastard"", thereby providing (together with Alan Sokal's Social Text parody) the best evidence for Paul de Man's view that theory should be defined negatively, based on the opposition it arouses.[60] However, Paglia's assessment of French writers is not purely negative. She has called Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex (1949) ""brilliant"", and identified Jean-Paul Sartre's work as part of a high period in literature. Paglia has praised Roland Barthes' Mythologies (1957) and Gilles Deleuze's Masochism: Coldness and Cruelty (1967), while finding both men's later work flawed. Of Gaston Bachelard, who influenced Paglia, she wrote ""[his] dignified yet fluid phenomenological descriptive method seemed to me ideal for art"", adding that he was ""the last modern French writer I took seriously"".https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille...Image By Fronteiras do Pensamento [CC BY-SA 2.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...)], via Wikimedia Commons",art and music

Williams College Professor Gage McWeeny (Ph.D., English and American Literature, Princeton University) has devoted part of his career to the study of twentieth century and contemporary, experimental, or conceptual writing and art. Using Sol LeWitt's wall drawings as a connection to conceptualism in literature, McWeeny sheds light on the writings of Andy Warhol, Kenneth Goldsmith, and others.David Lang, Pulitzer Prize winning composer for the ""Little Match Girl Passion"" (2008) and co-founder of the musical group Bang on a Can, will also make similar connections between Sol LeWitt's art and his own conceptualist and modernist compositions, as well as the conceptual music of Steve Reich and Tom Johnson.This lecture took place on July 18, 2013.Sol LeWitt: A Wall Drawing Retrospective is on view through 2033.",art and music

SULLIVAN    Book Number: 74801    Product format: HardbackWith a career that spans 60 years and a fan base that spans all ages, Tony Bennett recently turned 80, and marked the milestone with a year-long creative outburst that included a chart-topping CD of duets with a diverse array of fellow superstar performers, from Streisand and Bono to Stevie Wonder and the Dixie Chicks. He starred in a sensational NBC TV special and performed in one sold-out show after another around the world. As if this were not enough, the UN named him 2007's Humanitarian Award honoree and the Smithsonian selected one of his paintings for their permanent collection. This lovely volume is a glorious celebration of Bennett's lifelong dedication to his passion for painting and singing. In a warm and revealing narrative, he and Robert Sullivan discuss the significant events of his life and career, his personal philosophy and the influences that continue to infuse his creative ability. He reflects on times he has shared with, and lessons he has learned from, the likes of Frank Sinatra, Pearl Bailey, Louis Armstrong, David Hockney and many, many more. Readers are whisked from his childhood, living above the grocery store where his father worked, to the magnificent apartment from where he now looks out over Central Park. Along the way he affords us a glimpse of his inner life. The book is richly illustrated with more than 200 reproductions - most of them previously unpublished - of his beautiful artwork, as well as a number of rare items from his collection. An endlessly entertaining 212 pages 29.5cm x 27cm very lavishly illustrated in colour and b/w with detailed appendix including a discography, art biography and an awards and honours listing as well as a FREE MUSIC CD of six tracks all performed by Tony Bennett.

It's an amazing installation a village of portable sculpture dwellings that double as musical instruments.  The walls literally make music. Musicians famous and not so famous perform concerts and then the public is invited to jam on the creations. Any one young and old can play! Airlift programming highlights our city's underground art and under-the-radar artists, transporting the dynamic street culture, living folk culture and growing contemporary arts scene of New Orleans to far-flung locations around the world for exhibitions, workshops, festivals, performances, and collaborative projects.Airlift also brings influential artists from abroad to participate in collaborative endeavors with local artists in our own community. We believe that collaboration between artists and across communities shares resources, empowers learning and unites disparate groups in common and powerful goals.New Orleans Airlift is an artist-driven initiative that collaborates and creates alongside the artists and communities we support.Airlift was founded in 2008 by musician and artist manager Jay Pennington and Delaney Martin, a multi-media installation artist, as a response to the unparalleled destruction of Hurricane Katrina and its devastating aftermath which left local artists, like all New Orleanians, struggling for their lives and livelihoods.Jay and Delaney recognized a need for new audiences who could support these artists as they rebuilt their city. They dreamt up a one-time project that took city artists to Berlin and called it The New Orleans Airlift after the Berlin Airlift of WWII. Other exchange projects that used an import/export model and a multidisciplinary approach soon followed and the name stuck.New Orleans is the last great bastion of living folk culture in the United states. Airlift projects honor tradition alongside innovation, leading our artists, culture and communities in meaningful new directions.Tweet -  @dannywolverton https://twitter.com/dannywolvertonI invite you to follow me on facebook and twitter: http://www.facebook.com/realspecialheadhttps://twitter.com/dannywolverton http://www.specialhead.comhttp://www.facebook.com/wolvertondanny Special Head LevitationHe is  best known for his appearances on America’s Got Talent in 2013 /2014 and subsequent viral videos of his Levitation acts. His America's Got talent performances were viewed by more than 40 million people on YouTube alone!""The popularity amongst Children across America following my viral appearances really inspired me, That I've been given an opportunity to be a good roll model for kids. Thats a great reason to wake up in morning"" -Wolverton""My artistic Vision is greatly influenced by my upbringing in the Native American Peyote Way Church and the Baha'i Faith. I realized that  1,000 years ago all art, performance, music, and dance was done through spiritual inspiration. The original performances were ritual and Ceremony. It wasn't until the Renaissance  that making a living through art became more widespread. Through my performances I intend to bring us back to an age of mysticism. Reminding people that performance is a ritual and that magic can be spiritual. The Special Head show goes beyond a traditional magic show. Not only does Wolverton perform Music while simultaneously performing magic illusions, Wolverton also incorporates thought provoking theatrics into his many acts. Danny uses illusions to cause the viewer to question ""what it means to be human."" His show is flexible and can be adapted to entertain many different age groups.The Anarchestra is set up as an interactive art installation that the public gets to play. It can be tuned all to the same key making it hard to hit the wrong notes. You don't have to be a good musician to play it.

bxhPwMNZpgY,Wingmakers Music & Art,"There is something about this artwork and music  that touches one's soul. This particular piece (as with the others found at the Ancient Arrow site) is very busy, almost overwhelming to the eye.  I have tried to break it down for the eye and then put it back together again. The idea behind the paintings is that there is meaning in the symbols and there is communication that is going on at a deeper (subconscious?) level than we may readily perceive with our limited senses. The meaning of this piece is left up to the viewer and that is how it is and should be with all good art /music and myth I might add.  The work, for me, has spiritual meaning, yet if I was asked to tell you what exactly this piece is about, I could not. There is something sensual here to my ears and eyes, a multi-course feast (if you will) that the Creator (James?)  has brought together. This art and music is rumored to be from 'another universe.' It is modified (or somewhat diluted)  from the original because we don't have the same capabilities to perceive it display it and/or recreate it that the beings who created it have developed over eons. For instance, it is said that the pictures move or come alive when viewed in the individual chambers where they were found. Few have witnessed it . It is music and art that supposedly activates long dormant parts of our DNA, DNA that was intentionally genetically manipulated or altered by beings from other parts of the universe many thousands of years ago. Some on earth might have called them ""gods."" This is an ongoing, unfolding project designed by it's creators, the Lyricus teaching order, to open us up to dimensions we have here-to-fore not experienced. I am told we are now on the threshold of being ready for at least part of the information it can impart. The music and art here are from the Ancient Arrow site see: www.wingmakers.com also see www.Lyricus.org.",art and music

N0u04EqNVjo,The Art of Punk - Black Flag - Art + Music - MOCAtv,"On the first episode of ""The Art of Punk"" we dissect the art of the legendary Black Flag. From the iconic four bars symbols, to the many coveted and collected gig flyers, singles, and band t-shirts, all depicting the distinctive Indian ink drawn image and text by artist Raymond Pettibon. We start off in Los Angeles talking to two founding members singer Keith Morris, and bass player Chuck Dukowski, about what the scene was like in 1976 - setting the stage for the band's formation, as well as the bands name, and the creation of the iconic four bars symbol. Raymond Pettibon talks with us from his New York art studio. Back in LA we meet with Flea, from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, about how the art, the music, and that early LA scene impacted his own life and career. To wrap it all up we sit and talk at length, with Henry Rollins, at MOCA Grand Ave in Los Angeles, about all of the above and more. Created, directed, and Executive Produced by writer/author of 'Fucked Up + Photocopied', Bryan Ray Turcotte (Kill Your Idols), and Bo Bushnell (The Western Empire), The Art Of Punk traces the roots of the punk movement and the artists behind the iconic logos of punk bands such as: Black Flag (Raymond Pettibon), The Dead Kennedys (Winston Smith), and Crass (Dave King).In addition to profiling the artists, the series includes intimate interviews with former band members, notable artists, and celebrities who have been heavily influenced by the art of punk rock including Jello Biafra, Tim Biskup, Scott Campbell, Chuck Dukowski, Flea, Steve Olson, Penny Rimbaud, Henry Rollins, Owen Thornton, and Gee Vaucher.The filmmakers Bryan Ray Turcotte and Bo Bushnell take a unique approach to exploring the rich histories of these three seminal punk legends by focusing on the influential imagery and seeking out stories that have not been told yet through the artwork, which is integral to the importance and influence of each band.On June 11, 2013 The Art Of Punk debuts on MOCAtv with an episode on Raymond Pettibon and the artwork of Black Flag. The stories behind the art of the Dead Kennedys will debut on June 18, and June 25 will see the release of the Crass episode, all of which will be available at: www.youtube.com/MOCAtvCreated By:BRYAN RAY TURCOTTEhttps://twitter.com/bryanraymond www.KillYourIdols.comBO BUSHNELLhttps://twitter.com/BoBushnellInstagram.com/BoBushnellhttp://bobushnell.comDIRECTED BY:BRYAN RAY TURCOTTEBO BUSHNELLEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS:EMMA REEVESJOHN TOBAEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS:BRYAN RAY TURCOTTEBO BUSHNELLSTARRING:RAYMOND PETTIBONKEITH MORRISCHUCK DUKOWSKIHENRY ROLLINSFLEACAMERA:JOSH WEBBERBO BUSHNELLJASON BAKEREDITED BY:TIM BROOKSBEAST EDITORIALASSISTANT EDITOR:PAUL JAROLIMEKPRONERBEAST EDITORIALLOCATION SOUND:NOAH ALEXANDERCHARLES EASTMONDMOTION GRAPHIC DESIGN:BRENT STANGELMUSIC SUPERVISION:BETA PETROLMUSIC BY:RAW NERVETHEME MUSIC:SON THE FATHER by FUCKED UPCOURTESY BEGGARS GROUPADDITIONAL MUSIC BY:C.R.A.S.H.SCANNING BY:JESSE SPEARSSOUND MIXING:PHIL LANTZM SQUARED PRODUCTIONSCOLORIST:TIM BROOKSPHOTO STILLS PROVIDED BY:BRIAN TUCKERED COLVERSPOTRYAN RICHARDSONLike MOCA on Facebook: http://bit.ly/MOCAFacebookFollow MOCA on Twitter: http://bit.ly/MOCATwitter+1 MOCA on Google+: http://bit.ly/MOCAGooglePlusLike MOCA on Facebook: http://bit.ly/MOCAFacebookFollow MOCA on Twitter: http://bit.ly/MOCATwitter+1 MOCA on Google+: http://bit.ly/MOCAGooglePlusArtIsForYou20",art and music

The city emerges2.  Emperor Charles IV and the golden age of Bohemia3.  Jan Hus, Emperor Rudolf II and Saint John of Nepomuk4.  Baroque splendour and extravagance5.  Alphonse Mucha and Czech Art NouveauPrague is one of the most beautiful cities of Europe and, uniquely, has remained largely unscathed by war for over three hundred years. Its fame rests upon a magnificent range of Baroque churches, palaces and public buildings embellished with art and sculpture from the eighteenth century. However, often overlooked, Prague also houses extraordinary examples of cultural works from a variety of other centuries, in particular the medieval period of the early fourteenth century and, at the other end of the time spectrum, the Art Nouveau movement.The lectures will highlight major developments in Prague’s history from its origins in the ninth century up to today, while considering representative examples of works from successive artistic periods. Throughout the lectures, relevant excerpts of Prague’s musical tradition – from religious chants and Hussite hymns to the compositions of the two towering figures of twentieth century Czech music, Smetana and Dvorak – will be introduced.http://www.summerschool.uct.ac.za/pra...DISCLAIMER: The opinions expressed in the lecture are those of the lecturer and do not necessarily reflect those of the Summer School organisers.

For creative insights, I recommend what I call creative mod. Then, when you actually create, you go into editing mode. But it's important not to mix up these two thought processes.Creativity and productivity are the two things needed to create a work of art. Many people spend forever in creative mode where new creative insights come up, but they never develop the productivity skills to bring those ideas to the world. On the other side, there are people who have created such a rigid system for creation that the editing related tasks completely nullify the ability for creative insights to come about. This process should work with many different art forms including but not limited to:DrawingPaintingSculptureWriting Video CreationAnimationDesignFilmMusicetc.",art and music

Born in Salzburg, he showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. At 17, Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court, but grew restless and traveled in search of a better position. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his death. He wrote more than 600 works, many acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral music. He is among the most enduringly popular of classical composers, and his influence is profound on subsequent Western art music. Ludwig van Beethoven composed his own early works in the shadow of Mozart, and Joseph Haydn wrote: ""Posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years"".Thank you so much for watching this video by Halidon Music channel, we hope you enjoyed it!

This discussion spills over into debates about art's value to society ---- whether access to the arts is right as basic as education or health care, and whether it should be assessed and supported by government or left to the ""invisible hand"" of the free market. President Botstein explains why it is essential to ask these questions and offers a sturdy basis for evaluating them. He goes so far as to suggest that engaging with art can give our lives meaning and purpose.

Cancer can also significantly impact a child's psychosocial state - their emotions, behaviors, thoughts. A child's psychosocial state also impacts his or her relationships with family, friends, peers, etc. Art therapy and music therapy are just two of the many programs our staff offers to patients with cancer. These programs help patients express their emotions in a healthy, effective way. They also serve as a distraction when things get especially difficult during treatment or in the hospital.Our therapists are nationally certified and offer the best possible care to our patients and often times engage the entire family in sessions.Learn more about our music therapy program (here: http://bit.ly/11DHCvn) and our other psychosocial services for patients and their families (here:http://bit.ly/11DHyMc)Learn more about Tammi Young-Saleme (here:http://bit.ly/11DHzji)Watch a music therapy session at Nationwide Children's here: http://bit.ly/11DHCf3",art and music

The no-holds-barred art and music festival parties on for nine straight days until September 4. About 70,000 people are expected to show up this year. Tickets are an ultra-affordable $1,200. Burning Manners also have to get to Black Rock Desert by themselves. Smoking Man is billed as a festival full of eclectic artists, off-the-wall families, high power CEO douches and tech dweebs. Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page and Mark Zuckerberg have all partied it up at Hot Man before. Wouldn't you totally want to do some lines with these guys? The Smoldering Man was first held by Larry Harvey and some pals in 1986. It's called Burning Man because it started with some hippies chanting around a bonfire on the summer solstice on Baker Beach in San Fran. Since then, it's blown up into the spectacle you see now today. At the end of the festival, all the hipsters get together and burn a giant wooden man. It's so touching — especially if you're as high as a Space-X rocket.----------------------------------------­---------------------Go to https://www.patreon.com/tomonews and become a Patron now TomoNews is now on Patreon and we've got some cool perks for our hardcore fans.TomoNews is your best source for real news.

It was created in Brazil mainly by descendants of African slaves with Brazilian native influences, probably beginning in the 16th century. It is known by quick and complex moves, using mainly power, speed, and leverage for leg sweeps.The word capoeira probably comes from Tupi, referring to the areas of low vegetation in the Brazilian interior.http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/CapoeiraSpecial thanks (Agradecimento especial): RonaId Hoyoshttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jCgDG... ..",art and music

Thank you so much to the community for the support and kind words, they mean the absolute world to me!Original music for #GeekandSundry's #CriticalRoleSO this piece took research to pull off, I'd read that Matt had based a lot of Wildemount's culture off of real life Eastern European examples and I remember hearing a while back that his favourite instrument was violin so I implemented a mix of Eastern European folk music (Polish, Hungarian, etc.) into a very rhythmic orchestral. I'd started this piece a few days prior to the first episode so the fact that they're using music from the Witcher series actually coincides quite well with this. You may have noticed but I also worked Jason Charles Miller's original main theme into the ending and a violin passage mixed in with my own theme. I'll go into a more in depth analysis if enough people want to know how this was made.",art and music

ZM80F_J-QHE,Bjӧrk - Mutual Core - OFFICIAL - Art + Music - MOCAtv,"In ""Mutual Core,"" recorded by Björk for her seventh album Biophilia, the earth's geology is a metaphor for human relationships. Eruptions and earthquakes, the building of continents, the formation of mountain ranges and oceanic trenches: all are powerful signs of the earth's structure and mechanics. Represented musically by the violent interruption of block rocking beats, video director Andrew Thomas Huang here depicts the push and pull of tectonic plates with anthropomorphized rocks, lava and sand encircling Björk in dance, their psychedelic innards resembling the frayed strands of a Fritz Haeg rug.

How many of you remember this ad way back in the 70s, I think I had not long left school and this was one of those pieces of music that kept going round in my head. The Advertisement lasts for about 30 seconds and so the music is extremely short. I believe someone somewhere used samples from retro TV Ads and this was one of them. I have been tinkering with a new Keyboard, it's not top of the range but I think I may find the PSR 750 versatile enough for me. I have made an arrangement from this wonderful piece and have managed to make it last about 3 Minutes. I hope you like it.",art and music

YES! https://www.brainwavehub.com/binaural...▶Subscribe to the Brainwave Hub : http://www.youtube.com/user/binauralb...▶Subscribe to The Meditation Music Hub!* https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCydP...This audio, which can be used during work, study or meditation  uses alternating sequences of Beta, Alpha and Theta waves to encourage fluid and abstract creative thinking (Alpha & Theta), while at the same time maintaining a state of focus (Beta) for effective problem solving and high-level information processing. ▶SpecsFor each one hour session, the frequencies cycle through three frequency bands in 5 minute increments....Beta (12Hz) → Alpha (8-8.5hz) → Beta (13Hz) → Theta (7-7.5hz) → Beta (14hz) → Alpha (10hz) → Beta (14.5hz) → Theta (7-7.5hz) → Beta (15hz) → Alpha (10hz) → Beta (15.5hz) → Theta (7-7.5hz)This quick interplay between beta and theta/alpha promotes a balance between concrete thought and creative abstraction. This way we can encourage and bring to light new insights, generate new & original ideas, contemplate a concept from various points of view, and problem solve holistically. The beta phases serve to not only promote focus and concentration, but to also analyse, organise and therefore make sense of the abstractions derived from the more non linear holistic mind states induced by Theta and Alpha. In addition to using this audio during work or study, you can also use it in a rested state while meditating to assist with creative visualisation.  ▶TimestampsSelect an annotation on the screen, or click one of the timestamps below.Music & Isochronic Tones - 00:00 Music & Binaural Beats - 1:00:00Pure Isochronic Tones - 2:00:00Pure Binaural Beats - 3:00:00▶How do I listen?Headphones are recommended for best results. Listen at a quiet volume, or any level that you find non-intrusive. Listen during study or any task which requires focus and 'out-of-the-box' thinking. The addition of alpha and theta waves means that you can also use this session for creative visualisation, for which is a rested state is ideal.Focus and Creativity Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list... ▶To stay up to date on all of our audios, subscribe to the Brainwave Hub : http://www.youtube.com/user/binauralb... ▶Join us on Facebook & Google+ : https://www.facebook.com/binauralbrai...https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/1030415...",art and music

kfBvz2rG-NI,Nina Burmi sings Thumri | Vocal and tabla | Indian Classical Music,"#darbarfestival | Nina Burmi uses her smooth three-octave vocal range to explore the thumri style - a semi-classical genre intimately connected with dance, poetry, and drama.|*| Explore the finest Indian classical music and dance by signing up to our newsletter at: http://www.darbar.org/newsletter, and watch full length exclusive concerts in pristine HD on the Darbar Player: http://www.darbar.org/darbarplayer---------------------------------------------------------------------Learn more about the music:Thumri is a sensuous ‘light classical’ style, originating in Uttar Pradesh. The word is derived from the Hindi ‘thumakna’, meaning ‘to walk with dancing steps so as to make the ankle-bells tinkle’, and the genre remains closely connected with dance and drama. Ragas are treated more flexibly, and songs are often devotional, romantic, or even erotic in nature. Lyrics have a central role, often being based on folk tales or classical poetry, and commonly depicting the separation of lovers, or myths of Lord Krishna.Nina Burmi sings in the Kirana gharana style, tackling khayal, thumri, bhajan, and other forms. Currently living in the UK, she trained under the esteemed husband-wife pairing of Dilshad Khan and Parveen Sultana, and combines the latter’s wide vocal range with a more sparsely ornamented approach. In this song she is joined by top accompanists, with lyrics describing the tension and sorrow of a lover who is separated from Lord Krishna.Recorded for Darbar Festival 2006-Nina Burmi (vocal)-Ramesh Mishra (sarangi)-Sanju Sahai (tabla)Darbar believes in the power of Indian classical arts to stir, thrill and inspire. Through shared experiences and digital connectivity we ensure that one of the world’s finest art forms reaches the widest possible audience. Founded in 2006, we deliver premium quality live events, music education, broadcasts and online engagement through promoting artistic innovation and creative technology.

Let’s start with my preconceptions: I expected Japan’s capital, and home to the world’s largest urban population to be over the top and really in your face, with neon lights and anime at every turn and i certainly wasn’t disappointed. The streets are lined with towering, multi-storey buildings, each filled with mind bending department stores and arcades, offices to some of the world’s biggest brands and restaurants serving the best food you’ll ever taste.But despite all the apparent madness and chaos, spend a few days in Tokyo and it just makes sense. Here, efficiency is an art form. Japanese attention to detail is legendary, and it runs through everything, from food to public transport and urban planning. And yes, even the toilets. This trip was an educational and weirdly enlightening experience. I’ve been lucky to visit a lot of amazing places making these videos, but Tokyo is in a league of its own.So Tokyo, it’s big, it’s busy and it’s brilliant. As ever, let’s start with the airports.Flying from the UK you’ll come into one of Tokyo’s two major international airports, Haneda or Narita. Of course, you don’t need me to tell you that Tokyo is a really long way away, direct flights from Europe will take a whopping 12 hours for the nine and a half thousand kilometre journey.So you’ve got Haneda airport which is roughly 13 miles south of the city, and then you’ve got 50 miles east. Fortunately, both are really easy to get to noisy noisy Tokyo. Here’s what you need to know.From Haneda you have three main options, the airport limousine bus, a taxi or the monorail. The airport limousine takes between 30 and 45 minutes, stopping at most major hotels in the centre of town, with prices increasing for the night service between midnight and 5am.A taxi should take about half and hour depending on traffic, with prices depending where you’re being dropped off. There’s also a 20% extra charge between 10pm and 5am.However the quickest option is the airport’s dedicated monorail. It’ll get you into Hamamatsucho station in 13 minutes and from here you can connect to the circular Yamanote metro line to reach other parts of the city. The metro runs between 9 and 7 on weekdays and then 9 to 5 on weekends and public holidays. That’s Haneda! Here’s what you need to know about Narita.Narita is a whopping 50 miles east of Tokyo, so all of your transport options are going to take a while. The Airport Limousine bus and taxis runs from Narita but both will take anywhere between 90 minutes to 2 hours to reach central Tokyo. Instead, take the JR Narita Express. It’ll whisk into town in a little under an hour, and with this being Japan, the trains are on time and super efficient.A word of warning about getting home; if you’re flight’s on a Sunday, make sure you check the train times because there’s a reduced service. Check your departure time, and then allow plenty of extra time to get to the airport.",travel blogs

You will find the Capitol building, great hotels with rooftop views and a plethora of classic cars to look at or pick one to ride in. - Museum of Revolution : This is a great way to cool off and kill some time. It was once home to Presidents and is beyond beautiful as it was designed by Tiffany & Co.- Hotel National- This is a super fancy hotel with amazing views! We stopped to check it out as a lot of our famous favorites have stayed there. It's definitely a taxi distance away from Old Habana though. Bars:Hotel Inglaterra- This is an amazing rooftop bar with an incredible view! I had my share of sangria's here :) Floridita- One of Hemingway's must stop for a Daiquiri. I really loved these but keep in mind they are 6 CUC a piece compared to 3-4 CUC most other places.La Bodeguita De Medio- Hemingway Bar #2. This was his go-to spot for Mojitos! Beware this is a tourist trap and you might be drinking your mojito on the street depending on the time of the day. Cafe:Cafe De O'Reilly- This was our go-to for breakfast and morning coffee. Try the Cafe Bombon, it was my favorite.Dinner: La Guarida- We found this to be our favorite spot. The restaurant requires reservations, but if you forget like us, you can go up to the roof for amazing sunset views and the best food we had the whole trip! Tips:- The classic cars you see are Taxi's and cost more than the regular cars. You can however rent one for around 20 CUC for an hour city tour. Definitely worth it. Plus they make for great photos ;) - If you are staying in Old Habana, the entire area of Habana Vieja and everything I mentioned is super walkable.Not Sponsored.",travel blogs

6BoYfs2I0r8,How I make money while traveling the world (and eating),"►How to Start a Travel Blog: https://migrationology.com/how-to-sta...►How to Make Money While Traveling: https://migrationology.com/how-to-mak...The number one question I get asked is how I can afford to travel, while making money, and blogging. I'm going to answer how I make money, and also how I can afford to travel and eat in this video. Also, I'll share how I think you can do it too!There are many many ways to make money while traveling, and I have friends that are working on cruise ships, blogging, affiliate marketing, freelance writing, and even skydiving, while earning money to be able to maintain a lifestyle traveling. But instead of sharing all the ways on how to make money traveling, I'll first share the ways I make money.First I want to say that all of these ways that I make money while traveling are all the result of initially starting a blog back in 2009 and committing to writing quality and useful information on it on a regular basis. If you want to make money while traveling, I'd highly recommend you start a blog on whatever you're passionate about and begin blogging high quality useful information to show your expertise, and also connecting with others. (If you're just starting a travel blog, Travel Blog Success is an excellent course that I recommend: https://travelblogsuccess.com/?ref=18 [affiliate])1. Affiliate recommendations - This basically means earning a small commission as a referral. There are many companies (places like Amazon and Agoda.com for hotels) that offer a commission if you refer someone to a purchase. As an example, on my website I give away a lot of free useful tips about visiting Bangkok (http://migrationology.com/bangkok-tha...). And I also recommend a few hotels which, some of which I've previously stayed at, and others which I've just visit and highly recommend. So if you were to click one of the links and book that hotel, I would get a small commission as a referral. I only recommend things that I use myself or trust.2. My premium travel and food guides - The biggest way I make money while traveling is by selling my premium travel and food guides (http://migrationology.com/travel-guides/). Right now I have the Bangkok 101 things to do guide, Eating Thai Food Guide, Vegetarian Thai Food Guide, and the Delhi travel guide, and I'm working on more. I prefer to sell my own guides than doing advertising on my website, because I can trust in the quality of my own guides.3. Freelance writing - As a result of first starting my travel blog back in 2009, I've had the opportunity to do numerous freelance writing projects, some big and some small. I've written for a few inflight magazines, as well as CNN Travel, and various other newspapers, magazines, and websites. I used to dislike writing, but the more I started blogging about thing I really enjoyed (like food) the more I enjoyed it. And after committing to it and blogging, I've been able to connect with so many others and had chances to write for many places. A blog is a great way for you to have a public profile of your expertise.4. Video, YouTube - Finally, the fourth way of how I make money while traveling and blogging is through videos. I made the decision to start making videos and I have committed to it. Ads on some of my videos is another chunk of my monthly income.Along with how to make money while traveling and blogging, it's also important to say how I can afford to travel? Most of the money my wife and I make now goes back into our traveling and eating. However, it's all about your priorities. We don't own a car and pay for gas, and instead we choose to buy plane tickets and eat street food. You have to set your own goals and priorities and live intentionally to pursue them.Mentioned in the video:My travel guides: http://migrationology.com/travel-guides/My travel resources: http://migrationology.com/travel-reso...Learn to make a succesful travel blog (especially recommended if you're starting out): https://travelblogsuccess.com/?ref=18 [affiliate]Getting a job on a cruise ship: https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?...

Sir Thomas Acland wished to have garden and parkland fit for his family.Killerton is an 18th-century house in Broadclyst, Exeter, Devon, England, which, with its hillside garden and estate, has been owned by the National Trust since 1944 and is open to the public. The National Trust displays the house as a comfortable home. On display in the house is a collection of 18th- to 20th-century costumes, originally known as the Paulise de Bush collection, shown in period rooms.The estate covers some 2590 hectares (25.9 km2, 6400 acres).Included in the Estate is a steep wooded hillside with the remains of an Iron Age Hillfort on top of it, also known as Dolbury which has also yielded evidence of Roman occupation, thought to be a possible fort or marching camp within the Hillfort.Killerton House itself and the Bear's Hut summerhouse in the grounds are Grade II* listed buildings.The gardens are Grade II* listed in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.-----------------------------------------------------  CREDIT ROLL ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WEBSITEShttps://www.facebook.com/AndyWrightTr...Andy Wright Online (travel guru) - http://www.andywrightonline.co.ukTraining the Wright Way - http://www.trainingthewrightway.co.ukThe Wright Inspiration - http://www.thewrightinspiration.comWebsite Designs R Us - http://www.websitedesignsrus.co.ukArcade Software - http://www.arcadesoftware.co.ukArcade Video - http://www.arcade-video.co.uk_YOUTUBE CHANNEL DETAILSAll of my channels are listed here:Andy Wright Travel   https://www.youtube.com/c/AndyWrightT...Qigong 4 Health  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3LF...Training the Wright Way  https://www.youtube.com/c/TrainingThe...Andy's Product Reviews   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZE0...Massive Rant  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL6a...Talkin Really  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxjp..._MERCHANDISEhttps://teespring.com/en-GB/stores/an...----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------MUSIC USE IN MY VIDEOSMusic is licensed (royalty/copyright free) generally via AKM Musicor using Creative Commons Licences.

sEmMtAVGlJs,"Andy's National Trust Travel Blogs: Thomas Hardy's Cottage, Dorchester","Hardy's Cottage is a beautiful secluded place to visit if you are following the Thomas Hardy Trail through Dorset.The cottage, just outside Higher Bockhapmton, was built by Hardy's great-grandfather in 1800 and little has been altered externally since then.It is a popular place for tourists to visit and see where Hardy wrote Under the Greenwood Tree and Far from the Madding Crowd.The cottage is traditionally built from cob and the thatched roof is a wonderful backdrop to the roses, honeysuckle and japonica that climb the walls. Catch the cottage on a sunny Summers day and you won't find a prettier place in Dorset to spend a couple of hours.The cottage stands at the top of the hill off Cuckoo Lane in Higher Bockhampton and behind it stretches Egdon Heath, which Hardy wrote of in 'The Return of the Native'.

If you're a relatively new travel blogger or writer, then this course will help fill you up with inspiration and actionable tasks to fill up your editorial calendar. Learn more here: http://skl.sh/1Tt6sf9You don’t have to travel 365 days a year to be a travel blogger. Yup, seriously.There are plenty of travel bloggers who enjoy a job that keeps them in one city most of the year...they prefer living close to family members...they are sorting out finances before making a move...or they only have 2 weeks of vacation a year. (Sound familiar? Sign up for the entire course here: http://skl.sh/1Tt6sf9)Whether you aspire to one day travel every day of the year or you simply enjoy travel writing as a hobby, how can you successfully blog about travel when you’re not traveling? It’s a unique form of writer’s block to feel like you have no experiences or travel stories to write about simply because it’s been a little while since your last trip. But to be even remotely successful at travel blogging, you also have to be consistently publishing content. What’s a travel blogger to do?Well, I’m here to help you kick that writer’s block's ass and get content and posts queued up in your editorial calendar. By the end of this course, you will have a plethora of different types of posts to create and different brainstorming techniques so that you can write regular content for your blog, no matter how much you travel. You simply have to know how to dig up that content and use it in the best way possible.",travel blogs

Charlecote Park (grid reference SP263564) is a grand 16th-century country house, surrounded by its own deer park, on the banks of the River Avon near Wellesbourne, about 4 miles (6 km) east of Stratford-upon-Avon and 5.5 miles (9 km) south of Warwick, Warwickshire, England. It has been administered by the National Trust since 1946 and is open to the public. It is a Grade I listed building.The Lucy family owned the land since 1247. Charlecote Park was built in 1558 by Sir Thomas Lucy, and Queen Elizabeth I stayed in the room that is now the drawing room. Although the general outline of the Elizabethan house remains, nowadays it is in fact mostly Victorian.

35reI2AqbrM,A Day In The Life Of A Travel Blogger,"Join me at Big Berry in Slovenia as I show you what a day in the life of a travel blogger can look like. 'Can' is a crucial word - every day is different when you're a travel blogger. It's one of the things I love most about working as a travel blogger, but it does mean there's no 'typical' day. In this day in my life video, I'll show you what a day on a press trip look likes. Press trips are a common part of the travel blogger lifestyle, but just like the job itself, every press trip is different. This press trip is at a resort called Big Berry. It's on the Kolpa River in Slovenia and is a luxury resort for relaxation. That means this blogging trip was a lot more relaxed than usual! On this day, my main goal was to experience the resort and the Big Berry ethos, as well as making sure I had enough photos for the blog post I will be writing. In this vlog, I used the Canon M50, Canon 5D iii and DJI Mavic Air drone. Here's a full list of cameras and gear I use for blogging: https://www.alajode.com/blogging-vlog...As always, thanks for watching! I hope you enjoy this insight into a day in the life of a travel blogger - even if there's no such thing as a 'normal' day in this career!#travelblogger",travel blogs

In this episode I visit NUFFIELD PLACE, the home of Lord and Lady Nuffield, otherwise known as William Morris of the car name fame. He purchased the home and garden and made it his, by extending and modifying it to suit his needs.Career wise he started as an apprentice bicycle repairer and moved into making them when his request for a pay rise was rejected.  Later, he went into making cars and built the name of Morris around the Cowley area of Oxfordshire.Morris purchased Wolsley in the expansion process and during his lifetime put the profits to good use, donating about £8bn equivalent nowadays to charitable causes in the medical and education arena, such as Nuffield Orthopedic Hospital where I had my second back operation.While scooters were a problem, they made an effort and provided me with a pusher/wheelchair.  I think I got a bit of personal treatment with a guided tour and commentary.The only downfall was the gate to the disabled parking area which would be difficult for solo drivers.-----------------------------------------------------------------  CREDIT ROLL -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Andy Wright Online (travel guru) - www.andywrightonline.co.ukTraining the Wright Way - www.trainingthewrightway.co.ukThe Wright Inspiration - www.thewrightinspiration.comWebsite Designs R Us - www.websitedesignsrus.co.ukArcade Software - www.arcadesoftware.co.ukArcade Video - www.arcade-video.co.uk----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Music is licensed (royalty/copyright free) generally via AKM Musicor using Creative Commons Licences.

The garden has been in the ownership of the National Trust since 1955 when it was donated by Ida Copeland following the death of her son Geoffrey. A stained glass memorial bearing the Copeland Crest remains to this effect in Feock parish church. The house and garden had formerly been owned and developed by the Daniell family, which had made its fortune in the 18th Century Cornish copper mining industry.Many of the species that flourish in the mild Cornish air, including the rhododendrons and azaleas which are now such a feature of the garden, were planted by the Copelands including hydrangeas, camellias and flowering cherries, and exotics such as the ginkgo and various species of palm. They also ensured that the blossoms they nurtured had a wider, if unknowing audience. Mr Ronald Copeland was chairman and later managing director of his family's business, the Spode china factory, and flowers grown at Trelissick were used as models for those painted on ware produced at the works.The Copeland family crest, a horse's head, now decorates the weathervane on the turret of the stable block, making a pair with the Gilbert squirrels on the Victorian Gothic water tower, an echo of the family who lived here in the second half of the 19th century (their ancestor, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, was lost at sea in his tiny ship Squirrel after discovering Newfoundland).The garden is noted for its rare shrubs.

7V2pJOUe4E4,"Andy's National Trust Travel Blogs: Trerice, Cornwall","There are 500+ places of interest in the UK under the National Trust banner and I will be attempting to visit as many as I can, reporting as I do all the important stuff relative to accessibility. By the 16th century the Arundell family had become well-established and was connected by marriage to nearly all the other landed families in Cornwall.The status of the family increased through various members gaining good positions at the Royal court. Their legacy is this grand manor on a Cornish scale. The Arundells inherited Trerice through marriage around 700 years ago. By 1572 John Arundell V had begun building the house we know today. Ten years earlier his income had been boosted by marrying well. Son of the builder of Trerice, Sir John Arundell VI earned the title John for the King due to his role in the Civil War, especially his defence of Pendennis Castle in Falmouth for Charles I. After the restoration of Charles II, Richard Arundell became Baron Arundell in recognition of the support he and his father had given Charles I. We know little about how the Arundell family lived at Trerice. The Arundell line died out in 1768, and Trerice passed to the Aclands. It was the marriage of John, 2nd Baron Arundell to Margaret Acland in 1675 that eventually led to the great Devonian family based at Killerton inheriting Trerice. Sir Thomas Dyke Acland never lived at Trerice but often stayed on his political forays into Cornwall. He also used the Great Hall for entertaining. Initially arriving at Trerice as tenants of its last private owner, the Eltons took on the tenancy from the National Trust in 1953. At his own expense, John Elton paid for the repair of the remaining parts of Trerice - and went on to rebuild the fallen north wing. His aim was to create a comfortable family home.-----------------------------------------------------  CREDIT ROLL ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------https://www.facebook.com/AndyWrightTr...Andy Wright Online (travel guru) - www.andywrightonline.co.ukTraining the Wright Way - www.trainingthewrightway.co.ukThe Wright Inspiration - www.thewrightinspiration.comWebsite Designs R Us - www.websitedesignsrus.co.ukArcade Software - www.arcadesoftware.co.ukArcade Video - www.arcade-video.co.uk----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Music is licensed (royalty/copyright free) generally via AKM Musicor using Creative Commons Licences.

KUS88AGB0CA,"Andy's National Trust Travel Blogs: Tintagel Castle, King Arthur's seat of power","There are 500+ places of interest in the UK under the National Trust banner and I will be attempting to visit as many as I can, reporting as I do all the important stuff relative to accessibility. Tintagel castle is actually English Heritage, so I got my wires crossed and presumed it was NT because the OLD POST OFFICE is just down the road.  I think I may have gone to visit for free, oh well. It was not really very accessible but the guys did their best to get my scooter down the hill to the bottom, at £2 each way. You would need to be able to board a land rover, otherwise, the visit will be impossible.The site of Tintagel Castle has been inhabited at least since the late Roman period, and a community flourished here in the 5th to 7th centuries. In the 12th century Tintagel gained literary fame when Geoffrey of Monmouth named it as the place where King Arthur was conceived. These Arthurian associations may have inspired Richard, Earl of Cornwall, to build a castle at Tintagel in the 1230s, and the enduring legend still ensures Tintagel’s international renown.Additional Music:Ocean by THBD https://soundcloud.com/thbdsultanCreative Commons — Attribution 3.0 Unported— CC BY 3.0 http://creativecommons.org/licenses/b...Music provided by Audio Library https://youtu.be/VAz3HfbdKyQ-----------------------------------------------------  CREDIT ROLL ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------https://www.facebook.com/AndyWrightTr...Andy Wright Online (travel guru) - www.andywrightonline.co.ukTraining the Wright Way - www.trainingthewrightway.co.ukThe Wright Inspiration - www.thewrightinspiration.comWebsite Designs R Us - www.websitedesignsrus.co.ukArcade Software - www.arcadesoftware.co.ukArcade Video - www.arcade-video.co.uk----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Music is licensed (royalty/copyright free) generally via AKM Musicor using Creative Commons Licences.

We also cover off-the-beaten-path outdoor activities you won't find in a typical Naples tourism brochure, Naples itinerary or Naples, Italy city tour also known as Napoli Italia.10 Things to do in Naples, Italy Travel Guide Video Transcript: (NAPOLI)Tell anyone you’re travelling to Naples and you’ll likely get a few raised eyebrows with some side comments about the mafia, or grid-lock traffic, or garbage on the streets. Somewhere along the way, Naples seems to have earned a bad reputation, but we thought it all sounded a bit too harsh. We wanted to experience the city for ourselves, plus we’d also heard there was good pizza! We ended up having a grand ol’ time, so join on us as we show you what you can get up to with a couple of days in Naples, plus somewhere along the way, we’ll also reveal where we ate our favourite pizza. Piazza del Plebiscito seemed like a good place to start our tour. This is a large public square in Central Naples, that earned its name from the 1860 vote that brought Naples into the unified Kingdom of Italy. The plaza is surrounded by numerous attractions, including the Royal Palace of Naples on one side, and the Basilica of San Francesco di Paola.We then visited the Royal Palace of Naples. This was one of the four residences in Naples used by the Bourbon Kings during their rule of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.The admission fee was 4 Euros and this gave us access to the Royal Apartments where we got to admire porcelains, tapestries, sculptures and painted ceilings  found within the palace walls. We visited was Castel Nuovo, an imposing medieval castle that dates back to 1282. This castle was built when Charles I of Naples took the throne and moved his capital from Palermo to Naples.Admission to the castle was 6 Euros per person. We stopped by Caffe Gambrinus, a historic coffeehouse in the heart Naples for a bite and drink. We visited Galleria Umberto I, which is a gallery which vaulted iron and glass ceilings, where you can shop & people watch.This gallery dates back to the late 1880s and meant to be reminiscent of Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan.While in Naples, we took it upon ourselves to find the best pizza in the city. This involved eating a total of 10 pizzas over two days. In the end we decided Da Michele was our personal favourite.Because we always enjoy visiting outdoor markets wherever we go, we stopped by the Fish Market.Moving on to museums we visited Naples National Archaeological Museum. This museum holds the Farnese Marbles, which is an impressive collection of Roman copies of classical Greek sculptures and ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum.Another place we visited in Naples was the Quartieri Spagnoli, or Spanish Quarter. The streets in this quarter were laid down during the 16th century for the Spanish military barracks outside the city walls. The streets here are narrow and the buildings tall.And that’s a wrap for our quick 2-day tour of Naples. We hope this video gave you a few ideas of things you can do in the city and all the pizza you can eat in between.This is part of our Travel in Italy video series showcasing Italian food, Italian culture and Italian cuisine.

This week we are in the Spanish capital and we are going to show you twenty five of the best things to do in the city.  Final thoughts on your time in Madrid. Well, I really enjoyed the city. And I really found that it is super walk-able. We were here for 10 days and we hardly had to take the metro at all. We just took the bus once when we were visiting the stadium but the rest of the time we were able to walk wherever we needed to go. And also I think it is a great city for art lovers. There are so many galleries and museums to check out. And a lot of them are free in the evening. So keep that in mind.And now it is your turn. What did you think of Madrid? You know what? I absolutely loved Madrid. It is a city that just really clicked with me. We have a lot of friends that are living here long term and prior to coming here I had no idea like why would someone want to come to Madrid? Now I totally get it. I love the culture, I love the food, I love the nightlife. Everything is really cheap. I go to the grocery store and I can get a one liter thing of wine for just over a Euro. It is just a really affordable fun city to be in. And it is somewhere I hope I have a chance to come back to again soon.And that is a wrap of our time in Madrid! We had a splendid time and were truly sad to say goodbye to the city, but that just means we'll have to come back again. If you have any travel tips for Madrid, feel free to share those in the comments below.This is part of our Travel in Spain series.  We're making a series of videos showcasing Spanish culture, Spanish arts, Spanish foods, Spanish religion, Spanish cuisine and Spanish people.  All photos and video taken by Samuel Jeffery (Nomadic Samuel) and Audrey Bergner (That Backpacker).Music in this video courtesy of Audio Network",travel blogs

7Hk7PkV-Fb0,"Jubril Agoro ""How I Really Make Money ""  Travel Blogging ?","People keep asking me this:""Jubril, how do you make money and still travel the world?""I haven't actually broke this down in a video before like I'm about to here so watch the video to learn exactly how I make money all while traveling the world at the SAME TIME...Plus I'm having a free webinar where I outline exactly how I do it:And you are invited, you can register for free belowhttp://mrthinkoutsidethebox.com/Also, some things have really changed.....and I want to update you on what is actually working right now so you can avoid the common mistakes most people make that wastes so much time and money...The number one way I make money is:#1 running Facebook Ads for myself as well as a handful of other business owners and marketers by doing exactly this:I come up with the marketing material, write the ads, then run the ad campaigns for them.This is by far the most profitable and believe me, most people think Facebook ads are difficult to get working...But they're not...You just have to know how to write them.A perfect example is my client Tiffany......she is in the ultra-competitive finance industry.Where companies usually pay $20+ PER Lead in most cases.*I generate her leads on Facebook for 40 cents or less*[We've generated tens of thousands at this small cost]My secret?Matching the right audiences together and HOW we create the ads... [which it seems NOBODY does like I do]But there’s more...#2 Travel blogging - some cool side income but the real benefit is the awesome perks like free hotel stays, free travel and 1st class upgrades.All completely worth it... You could literally earn a few extra thousand bucks a month and travel lightly if that’s your thing. It can be that simple...#3 Video Production - Shooting videos for our clients, interviewing them and adding some additional 'B' roll footage and background music.[it's actually a lot easier than most people think with software that already comes loaded on your laptop in most cases]#4 Affiliate Offers - This is a BILLION dollar industry by itself. It's by simply referring offers from companies that I like and use their products myself. Here’s how it works:When I send emails about it and people buy the offer, I get paid. Its simple to do and no tech skills required for any of these ways I earn income really.#5 Hosting & Speaking at Events - We can charge business owners up to 5K to come to a live, in person workshop where we teach them the simple things that we would normally charge to do for them.Any of these can be learned much easier than you might believe...Here is what you need to know:Jon, a youtube marketer who works with business owners was losing thousands of dollars a month on Facebook Ads......he swallowed his pride and finally confessed this to me......then I taught him a few basic Facebook Ad strategies, and a year later...Over million dollars in revenue.So to get to the point... Do you want me to teach you what I showed Jon how to do as well as my other clients?If so, I'm holding a free training webinar where I will be revealing the exact strategies I taught Jon.Plus, if you sign up for the free webinar, the moment you sign up I’m going to immediately redirect you to a training video that shows you......what I showed Nathan, my kiwi student... who now generates 5 figures every month and travels the world full time... with a full time income.You can get all of that right here:http://mrthinkoutsidethebox.com/[Make sure to get on the list for the free webinar as well]If you have any desire to start a business online from scratch or learn how grow your business with Facebook ads then you need to be on that webinar.I'll see you there,Jubrilhttp://mrthinkoutsidethebox.com/",travel blogs

Xdya8eym9nM,"Street Food in Pakistan - ULTIMATE 16-HOUR PAKISTANI FOOD Tour in Lahore, Pakistan!","Thank you to Ali (Pakistan Travel Market): https://goo.gl/VY6NjHSUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos every week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribeT-shirts and caps: https://goo.gl/6WdK1lAlso, just published a full Pakistan travel guide: https://goo.gl/5MHgz4I’m very excited to share this first full street food in Pakistan video with you! We started our trip in Lahore, a vibrant, colorful, and packed full of food city. Our first day in Lahore turned out to be a 16 hour street food marathon in Lahore, and it was an amazing day!Get more details on my Pakistan Travel Guide: https://goo.gl/5MHgz4Sadiq Halwa Puri (https://goo.gl/maps/Yoy9dJ6steF2) - We began the day with a very common breakfast throughout Pakistan, halwa puri, but along with chana curry (chickpea curry). We ate off the car, enjoying every bit of the freshly fried puris and curry.Total price - 640 PKR ($4.78)Chacha Feeka Lassi (https://goo.gl/maps/RGQBRQaNj8p) - Next we drove over to Gawalmandi, one of the most legendary areas in Lahore for food. We headed straight to a breakfast staple, the lassi shop and had the most creamy heavy milkshake I’ve ever had, called a pera lassi.Roasted chickpeas - 25 PKR ($0.19) - After exiting an alley, right in front of us was a man selling chickpeas and corn roasted in black Himalayan salt. It’s a very common street food snack in Pakistan.Sweet potato - 80 PKR ($0.60) - Sweet potato is also a very common street food snack in Lahore, seasoned with masala and a type of citrus juice.Baba Kulfi Wala - Next we headed over to Shah Alami Market, another huge and bustling market in Lahore.Kulfi - 20 PKR ($0.15) each - One of the most famous places to eat ice cream in Lahore is Baba Kulfi Wala, and you’ll find a crowd of people standing around the corner of the road eating sticks of their famous kulfi.Orange juice - 50 PKR ($0.37)Chana chaat - 120 PKR ($0.89) per plate - One of my personal favorite Pakistani street food snacks of the day was chana chaat, a chickpea snack. He added in all sorts of spices, chutneys, and seasonings, to create a deliciously refreshing snack.Butt Karahi Tikka Restaurant - Easily one of the most well known restaurants in Lahore is Butt Karahi, specializing in curry made in a rounded pan, called a karahi (we will be eating a lot of karahi’s in Pakistan!). We ordered both a mutton karahi and chicken karahi. Both were amazing, filled with spices and butter, but the tenderness of the mutton was the winner.Total price - 5,600 PKR ($41.84)Siddique Fish Corner - You’ll notice that Lahore seems to come alive at night, and street food is everywhere at night. We began the evening with Siddique Fish Corner, one of the best fried fish stalls in Lahore. It was awesome, and so busy.Total price - 400 PKR ($2.99)Khalifa Balochi Sajji - Another Pakistani dish I wanted to try was chicken sajji, a type of hand rotisserie chicken. The atmosphere and cooking method was incredible.Total price - 390 PKR ($2.91)Khan Baba Restaurant - Finally for our last dinner on this 16 hour day of food in Pakistan, we went to one of Ali’s favorite restaurants in Lahore, Khan Baba. The goat chops were impressive as was the korma curry.Again, massive thank you to Ali, from Pakistan Travel Mart for hosting us in Pakistan, taking us around, and organizing everything.

We are currently exploring the Greek capital. We recently actually spent a few days traveling around Meteora and now we're finishing up our trip here in Athens. We've got two full days to explore the city which isn't a lot of time but we're going to try to do our best.Our first stop was one of the most recognized sights in Athens - the Parthenon, which was dedicated to the goddess Athena who was seen as the patron of Athens.After sunset we lingered atop Mount Lycabettus for some night views of the city before taking the funicular down to the bottom. Seeing the Acropolis all lit up at night was a pretty cool sight!Next up we visited the Temple of Zeus which once housed the statue of Zeus, and was considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.When it comes to shopping, there are a few different options. We made our way to Monastiraki, which is one of the principal shopping districts in Athens. Here we visited both the Flea Market and the antique shops in the area. The Agora was the central spot in ancient Greek city-states, and it is where people gathered.So we are wrapping up our time here in Athens. Any surprises or final thoughts to share? Yeah, something that really surprised me were just the amount of stray animals that I saw on the streets. I also thought there was really good dining options as well. We had a number of really good Greek meals and also some really good International food too.Final thoughts, I think this is a really underrated capital in Europe. A lot like Warsaw in Poland so if you have an opportunity to visit Athens in Greece definitely do so.So what did you think of Athens? Well, I thought it was a really cool city and I actually had a great time here. It kind of reminded me a little bit of Tel Aviv with the Mediterranean feel but also Berlin because it is very artsy and gritty. So it's a really cool place to check out. Great food, lots of attractions. You have a mix of antiquity with urban.And that's a wrap for Athens! We hope you enjoyed this city guide and that it'll come in handy when you plan your own trip.This is part of our Travel in Greece series.  We're making a series of videos showcasing Greek culture, Greek arts, Greek foods & Greek cuisine.  Music in this video courtesy of Audio Network",travel blogs

So I thought I'd share some more substantial thoughts on how to have the right mindset, expectations, and process to be successful in travel blogging. 5 years ago I benefited a lot from what others taught about blogging so, in turn, hopefully you will find my random thoughts useful in some way!VERY SORRY for the focus moving in and out.

v_KDI-PGFQU,"Andy's National Trust Travel Blogs: Max Gate, home of Thomas Hardy","Max Gate, an austere but sophisticated town house a short walk from the town centre of Dorchester, was the home of Dorset's most famous author and poet Thomas Hardy. Hardy, who designed the house in 1885, wanted to show that he was part of the wealthy middle classes of the area, to reflect his position as a successful writer, and to enable him to enter polite society. The house was named after a nearby tollgate keeper called Mack.Many of Hardy's possessions were dispersed before the Trust acquired the house, but we've furnished the rooms for you to enjoy the spaces he created to write and live in. He wrote some of his most famous novels here, including Tess of the d'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure, as well as much of his poetry.You will find the garden much as it was originally planned, with high walls and large trees encircling the property to preserve Hardy's privacy. The sundial, designed by Hardy, was erected in his memory.-----------------------------------------------------  CREDIT ROLL ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WEBSITEShttps://www.facebook.com/AndyWrightTr...Andy Wright Online (travel guru) - http://www.andywrightonline.co.ukTraining the Wright Way - http://www.trainingthewrightway.co.ukThe Wright Inspiration - http://www.thewrightinspiration.comWebsite Designs R Us - http://www.websitedesignsrus.co.ukArcade Software - http://www.arcadesoftware.co.ukArcade Video - http://www.arcade-video.co.uk_YOUTUBE CHANNEL DETAILSAll of my channels are listed here:Andy Wright Travel   https://www.youtube.com/user/soyoukanQigong 4 Health  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3LF...Training the Wright Way  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPIP...Andy's Product Reviews   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZE0...Massive Rant  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL6a...Talkin Really  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxjp..._MERCHANDISEhttps://teespring.com/en-GB/stores/an...----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------MUSIC USE IN MY VIDEOSMusic is licensed (royalty/copyright free) generally via AKM Musicor using Creative Commons Licences.

You can then show that you have rights to use the music should you receive a copyright claim or if you plan to monetize your channel. This is very important as it will prevent any possible strikes against your YouTube channel or videos.- Doesn't royalty-free music mean I can use it for free?*'Royalty-free' music is not the same as 'free music'. Unfortunately, this is a common misconception on the internet, and especially here on YouTube.Simply put, it means that royalties don't have to be paid to the creator each and every time it's used (ie. free of royalties); but instead, a one-time fixed fee is paid, which is via a license purchase. This gives you the rights to use the music and is also how I earn my living and feed my cat! :)- Do I have to buy a license for every video I make?No, you only need to purchase one 'regular' / standard license in order to use it in all your videos on YouTube, forever. If you wish to use another song, then you'll need to purchase another license for that song. - Can't I just give you credit in my videos, instead of buying a license?Unfortunately, no. Just giving credit to me in your videos doesn't protect you from copyright infringement in accordance to international law. A license is required to show YouTube that you have the proper rights to use my works on your videos, which is also needed if you looking to become a YouTube partner and monetize your videos.",travel blogs

1frA2LT8xkk,I made my Friend a NEW Travel Blog (Puzzlewood Vlog),I made my Friend a NEW Travel Blog (Puzzlewood Travel Vlog)I love travel blogging I have had a travel blog for 3 years now. It is even in my name... Joe Travel Blogs. But it is always so exciting at the start getting to create a new blog from scratch. It is a chance to recreate your own identity! But the problem is you only get to do that once. SO I decided I would help my friend Jack to create his own travel blog for when he goes travelling later in January. This way he gets a chance to share his travels if he wants to and I get the enjoyment of creating a travel blog from scratch again! Surely that is a win for both of us! Later on in the video we also head off to Puzzlewood for a little travel vlog! In order to get some great pictures to fill out his blog!

Jesters Cafe is an Australian franchise that has recently become quite popular in South Korea.  Featuring some of the best pies we've had in Korea, it's no surprise that it can get packed at times with both Koreans and foreigners alike.GEAR WE USEOlympus OM-D E-M5 II: http://amzn.to/1OchS7tCanon G7X: http://amzn.to/1YdjsYX Olympus 14-150mm II Lens: http://amzn.to/1Y79zeM Rode Video Mic GO: http://amzn.to/1WDKtVM Joby Gorilla Pod: http://amzn.to/1PgoY5F SanDisk 16GB Extreme Pro: http://amzn.to/25KEErs SOCIAL MEDIA & TRAVEL BLOGSAUDREY:blog: http://thatbackpacker.com/instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thatbackpac...facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thatbackpackertwitter: https://twitter.com/ThatBackpacker SAMUEL:blog: http://nomadicsamuel.com/ facebook: https://www.facebook.com/nomadicsamuel twitter: https://twitter.com/NomadicSamuelinstragram: https://www.instagram.com/nomadicsamuel/With branches all over the country it's not difficult to locate one near you. Jesters is famous for its meat pies and various kinds of specialty options (including sweet and savoury). We decided to indulge in our two favourites (Blueberry Apple and Maharaja) which we immediately scarfed down.  The pies themselves aren't overly big but they're very filling and high calories.Although we're English teachers in South Korea, our main passion and projects these days revolve around our online travel blogs that we run.  Our is to transition to becoming digital nomads on the road where we tell travel stories, share travel tips, take travel photos and shoot travel videos.  It's honestly far more work than our teaching jobs entail.  In order for us to become successful, we've been blogging late at night after our teaching shifts and often spending a lot of time on the weekends working on random projects related to our sites that we run together.We show you Nomadic Samuel, That Backpacker, Backpacking Travel Blog and Smiling Faces Travel Photos. Of course, no video of ours would be completed without our quirky bloopers at the end.Overall we highly recommend you visit Jesters if you're in Korea for fast wifi and delicious pies -- betcha can't just eat one!http://nomadicsamuel.com/video-blog/t...You're destroying the pie!Today we are having the blueberry kiss, which is blueberry custard inside of a pie and I've turned it into mush but it tastes amazing.That's a big bite.  It's hot!We're at our favorite cafe in my area.  It is a place called Jesters and it is an Australian style cafe. The reason we've come here is so that we can work on our online projects.  We're both basically digital nomads.  We're teachers right now in Korea but we're transitioning to digital nomads and so every weekend on Saturday or Sunday - one day - we come here often.  We come because we get awesome and fast wifi and delicious pies.Here you have my website 'ThatBackpacker.com"" and it is just a random collection of stories and anecdotes and photo essays from my travels.And here is my main site ""NomadicSamuel.com"" and it is a real quirky travel blog featuring a lot of photo essays, travel stories mostly involving self-depreciating humor involving me doing weird wacky stuff and videos.This other site is called ""Backpacking-Travel-Blog.com"" this is one that Sam and I run together and we feature a lot of videos that we make for YouTube and just photo essays and planning trips for upcoming travels - that sort of thing.We like to come here early in the morning because the place is empty as they hardly have any customers so we feel like we're at home in our own little space.  Check it out.  It's a nice little cozy environment.  It is nice and bright, which is something we like.Today I'm going to be working on my site, so first I'm just been reading a few comments that people left that I have to reply to those and then I've been in touch with a few advertisers, so I need to reply to them and perhaps write a few articles.  That is what my Saturday entails.  Busy, busy!  Yes.Aside from the things Audrey mentioned I'll be doing a lot of the same as what she is doing.  I also have a lot of social media platforms I'm going to be rocking on twitter, facebook, stumble upon.And the amount of emails in my inbox makes me want to cry.Alright, take three - no take two!Proudly presented by: http://nomadicsamuel.com , http://smilingfacestravelphotos.com , http://travel-photography-tips.com , http://thatbackpacker.com , http://backpacking-travel-blog.com ,  This video features the song ''Solamente - FrenchLAB"" available under a Creative Commons Attribution-Commercial license.",travel blogs

Xkwio1KZaZE,"028 Foam Parties, Festivals and Jungleparc Tree Top Kids Activities while Sailing Mallorca","While stuck at anchor in Santa Ponsa waiting for our water pump and battery charger to arrive, we decide to go ashore and check the ridiculously loud music keeping us awake at night! It turned out to be the Festival del Rei en Jaumer - a week long festival of food, music and entertainment which ended with a foam party and magnificent firework display!Having Granddad onboard gave us another excuse to go to Palma again and this time we visited the impressive, Palma Cathedral and try the local paella and sangria.Two weeks without water pump meant we had to desperately seek out swimming pools and beach showers and manually pump 20L of water into the solar shower.. which didn't go far with 6 of us onboard! It was a smelly boat by the time our @MARCOspaCompany water pump and the #mastervolt battery charger turned up. The kids quickly turned the packaging into new toys and Woody fitted the new equipment and fun though Santa Ponsa was, it was a relief to be on the move againHomeschooling continued and for science we made a @yankodesign scale model of Theo Jansen's strandbeest - so cool! We then visited @JungleParcMallorc the Treetops adventure playground for some fun in the trees! The Balearic islands seemed to attract a lot of storms later in the season and we began thinking of shelter for the winter and perhaps even finding a Spanish school for the kids as they've had little opportunities to socialise with other kids lately.Then more maintenance issues - our @Raymarine autopilot gave up! :/  It becomes quite demoralising after a while - things constantly breaking down all the time.We finally left Mallorca (or is it Majorca?) for Ibiza in what we thought was a good weather window, but as Woody was calmly enjoying a cup of his beloved @yorkshiretea we sailed straight into a thunderstorm!Luckily we came through unscathed so we poled out the head sail (the set up copied from a year 2000 @AmelYachts brochure!) and headed for San Antonio. Rowan read her current favourite book by @DanBrown while the boys played and learned about sound signals and navigation! Then disaster struck. As we were leaving the dock after a final water stop, we ripped a huge hole in the dinghy which on top of everything else going wrong on the boat was completely demoralising - this is not a good way to 'live the dream'. We still had several hundred miles to travel.. and now no dinghy to get to shore.So as the end of the summer season draws to a close - we head to Almerimar for the winter and catch up with blogs and maintenance.. and if anyone has any of the following going spare... Dinghy, AIS transponder, autopilot, microwave, depth sounder, washing machine, wind instruments, folding bike, solar panels, boat fridge, new batteries... please let us know!...in fact just message us for the whole list! ;)ⒸⓄⓃⓃⒺⒸⓉ▷PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/mothershipadriftContributions to the video blog budget greatly appreciated!▷YOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/c/mothershipa...Vlogs and mini vlogs from onboard the boat▷INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/mothershipa...Photos of the boat, the crew and other sailing families and characters▷FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/mothershipad...Updates and photos - as often possible - from the boat▷THIS VIDEO LINK: https://youtu.be/Xkwio1KZaZEPaste this into your blog or post for some exciting content▷WEBSITE: https://www.mothershipadrift.com/",travel blogs

Don't believe me? Come with me to the stunning Andaman and Nicobar Islands Union Territory of India. This is incredible India!We started at Kala Pathar beach which is the most beautiful and picturesque beach on Havelock Island. Then we take our scooters to the start of the 1.8km trek point to get to Elephant Beach. Elephant Beach is perfect for snorkelling and getting away from the crowded main beaches.After swimming, dancing, and snorkelling with the fish on Elephant Beach we grab lunch on the way to Radhanagar Beach - the largest and most popular beach on Havelock Island. Then I tell you one of the reasons why I love India so much, India simply has it all!Forget Goa, forget any other beach in India; the Andaman and Nicobar Islands have the best beaches I've seen in India so far! Havelock certainly has the best beaches between it and Neil Island. Neil Island is more for relaxing on the beach.In 2018 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi renamed Havelock Island to Swaraj Dweep, Ross Island to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Island, and Neil Island to Shaheed Dweep.👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇1) SUBSCRIBE! ✔ Click https://www.youtube.com/c/KarlRock/?s...Then smash the BELL ICON so you don't miss a 🔴live stream or video.2) TRAVELLING TO INDIA🇮🇳?Travel safely & confidently with my India Survival Guide (Quick-Start Safety Guide) https://indiasurvivalguide.com.3) WANT TO LEARN HINDI?Learn Hindi Faster Than I Did! eBook at https://karlrock.com.4) MEETUP LOCATIONS & ROCK NEWS Sign-up 💌 http://join.karlrock.com.5) LET'S CONNECT:https://www.instagram.com/iamkarlrock/https://www.facebook.com/iamkarlrockhttps://twitter.com/iamkarlrock📷🎥🤳 https://blog.indiasurvivalguide.com/w...#IncredibleIndia #India #Andamans #Travel #Beaches",travel blogs

lDoLLhswOwY,"25 Things To Do in Tokyo, Japan (Watch This Before You Go)","Get info about things to do, where to stay, and the best food to eat on your visit to Tokyo, Japan. Here's the guide: https://migrationology.com/tokyo-trav...Tokyo (東京), Japan, is one of the world's greatest cities, and there's so much to do and see when you visit. From temples and shrines, to gardens and museums, you'll never run out of attractions. Out of all the things you could do, I've chosen a top 25 list for this awesome city (and just so you know food is my first choice in Tokyo)!1. Ameya-Yokochō (アメヤ横丁) - A giant open air market that offers clothes, cosmetics, food, and restaurants and bars.2. Meiji Shrine (明治神宮) - This Shinto shrine, surrounded by beautiful forest, is extremely significant.3. Ryogoku Kokugikan (両国国技館) - Even if it's not fight season, you can go to the free sumo museum and eat sumo chankonabe.4. Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden (新宿御苑) - The garden is a beautiful attraction in Tokyo, with French gardens, Japanese gardens, and a green house.5. Ginza (銀座) / Yurakucho (有楽町) - Ginza is a great area of town for upscale shopping and dining, while Yurakucho is famous for Izakaya bars and restaurants under the railroad track.6. Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building (東京都庁舎) - There are a lot of things to do in Tokyo where you have to pay, but here, you can go to the 45th floor for free.7. Tsukiji Market (築地市場) - One of the most famous attractions in all of Tokyo is the Tsukiji Market (築地市場), the biggest seafood market in the world. 8. Shibuya (渋谷区) - With the busiest intersection in the world, Shibuya (渋谷区) is also home to shopping and restaurant.9. Sumida River (隅田川) - At Tokyo's Sumida River, you can either just walk around the park and enjoy the riverside views, or you can take the Tokyo Cruise in a boat.10. Tokyo Imperial Palace (皇居) - This is the home of the emperor of Japan. To enter the grounds, you have to make a tour booking on the official website11. Ueno Park (上野公園), Tokyo National Museum (東京国立博物館) - Ueno Park is a huge public park in Tokyo with shrines, gardens and a number of museums.12. Tokyo Skytree (東京スカイツリー) - They call it Tokyo's biggest attractions. It's a huge communications tower with various viewing decks and galleries.13. Harajuku (原宿), Takeshita Street (竹下通り) - Famous for its street market and cosplay that takes place, this is a place in the city to see and be seen.14. Senso-ji (金龍山浅草寺) - Visiting this temple is one of the top things to do in Tokyo, frequented by both tourists and religious pilgrims. It's the oldest temple in Tokyo.15. Edo-Tokyo Museum (江戸東京博物館) - It looks a little like a UFO, but it's one of Tokyo's main museums, that aims to preserve the history of the city.16. Fine Dining - Let's just face it, Tokyo is one of the best cities in the world for high class dining - atmosphere, presentation, food, it's all just stunning!17. Akihabara Electric Town (秋葉原電気街) - If you love electronics and gaming, you're going to love the area of Akihabara. You'll also find those infamous maid cafes here.18. Tokyo Stock Exchange (東京証券取引所) - Another free attraction in Tokyo is to be a guest at the stock exchange where you can see the Japanese Nikkei being traded.19. Roppongi (六本木) - Home to the Mori Art Museum and a hotspot for nightlife in the city, Roppongi is an exciting area of town.20. Odaiba (お台場) - This area of Tokyo is full of things to do like Legoland, and Palette Town, an indoor amusement park. It's also known as Tokyo's entertainment island.21. Yoyogi Park (代々木公園) - Located next to Meiji Shrine, and just a short distance from Harajuku and Shinjuku, this park is popular for exercise and dance.22. Nezu (根津), Yanaka (谷中 (台東区) - Tokyo is a truly modern city, but there are a couple places like Nezu and Yanaka that have held strong to their traditional and cultural roots. 23. Onsen (温泉) - You've got to strip down naked before you can enter a Japanese public bath.24. Mount Takao (高尾山) - Just 50 km from central Tokyo, this mountain is popular for climbing and is a sacred religious mountains. Makes a good day trip from Tokyo.25. Food - Finally, food is the reason I visited Japan, and I think eating is by all means one of the best things to do in Tokyo. Food is everywhere, and not only does it taste amazing, but the care that goes into Japanese cuisine is incredible.Thank you very much for watching this video that includes some of the best things to do in Tokyo. I hope it will give you inspiration to visit and eat through this amazing city.Tokyo travel guide for food lovers: http://wp.me/psd9b-4EASubscribe: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_c...All music in this video courtesy of AudioNetwork.comSupport my videos: http://migrationology.com/donate/",travel blogs

Nowhere is life celebrated more than in the city’s nearly 700 pubs. Nothing matters more to Dubliners than having a good time or, as locals call it, the craic.Of all the gifts, Dublin has given to the world, perhaps the most intoxicating are its stories. Originally built for the sons of the Irish gentry, the ivy-covered stone buildings of Trinity College are home to some of the oldest remaining manuscripts in the world, including the 1000-year-old Book of Kells.Dubliner Jonathan Swift, once said, “May you live all the days of your life.” There is no better way to define Dublin.

Official Exchange Rate = $1 USD = 64.14 Indian Rupee (current as of May, 2017)Transportation in India (City to city)1) We highly recommend train travel in India over taking the bus2) Book your train tickets in advance online (we used cleartrip.com)3) If you don't book tickets in advance check at major train stations to see if they have tickets reserved for foreign travelers under the tourist quota.Local transportation1) If you're traveling at a budget or mid-range level you'll definitely be taking your share of taxis, auto-rickshaws and man-powered rickshaws.2) Try to know what a ride should cost in advance by researching, asking at your hotel or asking a local3) Be prepared to bargain as rickshaw drivers often try to rip tourists offAccommodations in India1) Hostel in India - can start as low as $2 to 3 USD and upwards2) 3 star Hotel in India - ($20 to $40 USD)3) 4 or 5 star Hotel in India - (sky is the limit)We tried to book our hotels around areas of the city we'd be exploring by day and night. Staying on the outskirts means much longer local transportation time.Health in India1) Make sure to get all of your recommend shots and vaccinations before going to India. Check online or with your doctor to find out what you need to get specifically2) Carry hand-sanitizer and wet wipes to clean your hands and dirty objects you may encounter like filthy door handles3) Drink only bottled water4) Have Imodium handy in case you get sick to your stomach Safety in India1) Dress modestly (especially if you're a female)2) Don't arrive late at night in train stations3) Safety in numbers if you're a female travelerGeneral Travel Tips for India1) Don't try to do too much or have too fast of a schedule (slow versus fast travel)2) Pick a particular region and don't try to cover all of India3) Mix up smaller cities with bigger cities on your itinerary in IndiaWhat to eat in India1) Research restaurants online on sites like tripadvisor or food vlogs2) Only eat street food or at restaurants that are busy with locals3) Ask hotel staff or locals you encounter for recommendationsBudget meals in India can be had for roughly $2 to $5 in USD per person and fine dining get really expensive. Things we LOVED about India(I love India)1) Incredible train rides 2) Amazing attractions 3) Diversity of regions in India (how different they are)4) Beautiful temples, mosques and architecture5) Great value in terms of what you spend for what you get6) The sense of adventure not knowing what will happenThings we HATED about India (I hate India)1) Getting sick and having stomach issues2) Getting hassled by aggressive touts, rickshaw drivers and vendors3) Often not arriving on time or as scheduledFinal ThoughtsIndia is one of the most adventurous countries we've ever visited as travelers.

pmZPENhX8m4,"Japanese Baseball Game Experience in Tokyo, Japan","Come join me for a Japanese Baseball Game experience at Meiji Jingu Stadium as I watch the Yakult Swallows play against the Chunichi Dragons in Tokyo, Japan. Going to a baseball game in Japan is affordable and the overall experience is incredible given how passionate the fans are for each team. In terms of prices the ticket for the baseball game was 1,300 Yen, beer was 500 Yen and food items were between 400 to 750 Yen in general. Basically, you could watch a game, have a beer and a bite to eat for under $25 USD. If you'd like to watch a baseball game in Tokyo you have the options of the Dragons or the Swallows. The Dragons are the most famous team in the league and tickets are hard to come by so book in advance espeically during the summer months or on weekends.

Today is a bit of a special episode in the sense that I'm not with Audrey. Audrey is off visiting a friend here in Tokyo, Japan.And what I'm doing today is I'm heading over to the metro station right now with a plan of traveling 4 stops to watch a baseball game here in Tokyo.And I can't wait to share the entire experience with you because going to a baseball game in Japan is a pretty unique experience.Finally made it. Jingu Stadium. So guys tonight we've got the Swallows versus the Dragons. And the fans are basically directed to different sides of the stadium so the Swallows fans would go to the first base side as you can see over there on the left and fans of the Dragons would go to the third base side as indicated on the right.Tokyo Yakult Swallows! Rising! That is the official slogan.So a few fun facts before I head into the stadium. Japanese Baseball League basically has 12 professional teams I believe. And the teams are not named after cities they are named after companies.So the very first game we went to in Osaka we watched the Hanshin Tigers and they are named after the Hanshin Electric Company. And sometimes there is multiple teams in some of the big cities. For instance, in Tokyo there is two teams. In Osaka there is two teams.So yeah it is kind of interesting. It is a smaller league but the fans are super passionate. If it is anything like the game we went to in Osaka I'm going to be in for a real treat. I'm inside Jingu Stadium but before I sit down and start watching the game I've got to show you the concession. Like the options here at Japanese baseball games is incredible. Like the diversity of food that you can pick up is just insane. Also the prices are really reasonable so let's go take a little bit of a tour of the concessions here at the stadium.Easily one of the coolest things about baseball here in Japan is that every player has a unique song for them. So when they come up to bat the crowd just has this unique chant that is only for them and it just makes it so festive and so cool.Okay guys just a few final thoughts here from the game. That was simply awesome. Going to a baseball game in Japan is a must. It is the number one spectator sport in the country. The entertainment value is insane. Even if you're not a baseball fan I'd highly recommend going. The tickets are affordable, the food the concession food is affordable and the entertainment value is incredible. The level of play is really high, the fans get into it like I've never seen fans so passionate. So if you're thinking of going to a baseball game in Japan definitely do it and we'll see you guys soon with more food and travel videos from Japan. Ciao for now.This is part of our Travel in Japan video series showcasing Japanese food, Japanese culture and Japanese cuisine.  Music We Use: http://bit.ly/SamAudreyMusic",travel blogs

Krakow in the summertime was wonderful! We spent our time enjoying castle views from the river side, exploring neighbourhoods covered in street art, eating some of the best pierogie of our lives, and also discovering what we think may be the best ice cream. The following is our travel guide to some of the best things to do in Krakow!Wawel Castle is Krakow's crowning jewel, and for centuries it was the residence of the kings of Poland. You can see a mix of Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque architecture all in one place. While in the city, we also had to walk the Royal Route, which was once the historic coronation path of Polish kings.After visiting the basilica, we spent a bit of time walking the Main Square, which just so happens to be Europe's largest medieval town square.And that’s it for our visit to Krakow! We hope this video gave you a few ideas of things to do around the city. If you have any other places to add to this list or any tips for fellow travellers visiting Krakow feel free to share those.This is part of our Travel in Poland video series showcasing Polish food, Polish culture, Polish cuisine while visiting Kraków Polska.Music by Ehrling: https://soundcloud.com/ehrling""You and Me"" and ""Champagne Ocean""",travel blogs

We also cover off-the-beaten-path activities that you won't find in your typical tourism brochure or Lisbon city guide.20 things to do in Lisbon, Portugal | Top Attractions Travel Guide:Our first stop of the day was Sao Jorge Castle, which is an old Moorish fortification that sits on a hill overlooking Lisbon and the Tagus River. You can get some nice panoramic views of the city from here, and they also have peacocks roaming the grounds.Miradouro das Portas do Sol is one of the many look out points in Lisbon that offers postcard-perfect views of the city. This particular terrace overlooks the Alfama district and it is always popular with tourists.Carmo is a mediaeval convent that was ruined during the 1755 earthquake, and today it is used as an archaeological museum.  It's a strange feeling walking down the ruined nave of the church and seeing blue skies above your head, but that's exactly what makes it worth a visit. Another place to visit is Belem Tower. The tower was built on the banks of the Tagus River, and it was meant to act as both a defense system and a ceremonial gateway into Lisbon.The Jeronimos Monastery is one of the most visited sights in Lisbon. It's one of the best examples of Late Gothic Manueline architecture, so have a close look at the intricate detailing when you visit. A fun way to get around Lisbon's hilly streets is by riding the trams. There are different lines across the city, but #28 is the most popular one with visitors.The Santa Justa lift is an elevator that connects the lower streets of Baixa with Carmo Square, and it is the only remaining vertical elevator in Lisbon. Though it is meant to serve a functional role, it is also quite popular with visitors who find the elevator a novel idea. And that's a wrap for our week in the Portuguese capital! We hope you enjoyed this video and that it gave you some ideas of things to do in Lisbon.

UvDGBIkJaqQ,"Chinese Street Food DAN DAN NOODLE Tour in Sichuan, China | INSANELY GOOD and SPICY Szechuan Noodles","One of the best Chinese street foods you will ever eat in China is the Dan Dan Noodles!  Spicy Chinese Dan Dan noodles are the best street food in China! If you love spicy Sichuan food and street food in China, then you're going to love Dan Dan noodles, because they are so flavorful and covered in a rich chili oil!In this Chinese street food video, we're bringing you on a full on Dan Dan noodle tour of Chengdu, China, DEEP in the heart of Sichuan in Southwest China. This is the land of delicious and spicy Sichuan cuisine, sometimes spelled Szechuan cuisine. There are so many famous Sichuan foods to try here in Chengdu, but today, we are trying 4 different variations of Dan Dan noodles, also sometimes called Zajiang noodles.

In my opinion, the best noodle dish in China is dan dan noodles, right here in Chengdu, Sichuan. China has some of the best street food around the world, and these dan dan noodles were INSANELY GOOD, some of the best noodles in China for sure!If you're traveling to China to eat and try different street foods, and perhaps want to learn a little bit about Chinese food and chinese cooking in the process, you need to try a few different variations of Dan Dan noodles. When they prepare the traditional Chinese dan dan noodle recipe right on the street, you can watch as they scoop the main ingredients like chili oil, soy sauce, sichuan peppercorn, and garlic right into the noodle bowl and then place the steaming hot noodles right over top. It's truly satisfying! After they put the noodles over top, they place their signature fried ground pork on top, known in Chinese as shaozi. When your dan dan noodles arrive to your table, it is very important to mix up all the chili oil and all of the ingredients throughout. This ensures that the flavour and the hot oil gets coated onto each noodle before you take a bite. It's also quite satisfying mixing the noodles and watching the dark red oil slowly turn each noodle from white into red and silky smooth. When you take your first bite, you'll understand why this is one of the BEST Chinese street foods you need to try. The spicy noodles are coated with an incredibly aromatic chili oil and really send you straight up to heaven! It's one of the best forms of Chinese cooking!

lfsVLRVwfLA,We Tried Turkish Street Food in Istanbul,"Trying Turkish food in Istanbul. We have just arrived in Turkey and you know how much we love finding local food, so we are heading out in Istanbul to try out some of the local Turkey food.On our way to breakfast we had to grab a walking snack called Simet before finding Van Kahvalti to have a traditional Turkish breakfast plus menemen and free flowing Turkish tea.  We were lucky enough to try a winter based drink called Salep aka warm Christmas soup.The coffee machine was broken so we headed to Konotrop for some hipster Australian coffee and hipster Turkish coffee before having the craziest ice cream experience in our life!After the break we head to Sutlac Nizam Pide to try what we thought was Turkish Pizza (Pide) at least we managed to have a taste of Ayran...not sure if we regret it haha!From there we head to the Bosphorus to try Balik Ekmek and pickle juice...I have no idea where we found the room to try Borek on the way to the spice market...but not before trying some more coffee.To end it all we went to Gullouglu to have some Baklava!Thanks for watching everyone hope you enjoyed it :)Turkey Trip with Intrepid Travel (Real Turkey): http://bit.ly/intrepidtravelauWhere we get our incredible music from: http://share.epidemicsound.com/flying...

Ozi0BCzCRYw,Canary Islands Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"The Canary Islands are a Spanish archipelago in the Atlantic Ocean, just off Morocco in North Africa. Formed by volcanic eruptions and shaped by hot desert winds, they are comprised of 7 main islands.When powerful seismic forces lifted these islands out of the ocean millions of years ago, they sculpted landscapes of unimaginable beauty. So spectacular are the Canary Islands that for centuries, it was believed that this archipelago formed the peaks of the legendary lost city of Atlantis.Today, the Canary Islands are a magnet for sun seekers, beachcombers and adventurers from all over the world.With, 160 miles of coastline, 150 beaches and a climate that feels like it is always spring, the island of Fuerteventura is a perfect place to slow down and relax.A short ferry ride to the west of Fuerteventura is Gran Canaria - a place of ever changing climates and vistas.This island abounds with otherworldly landscapes that have been inspiring visitors for centuries. Take a hike to Pilancones Natural Park. The spectacular plateaus and cool ravines in this area are around 12 million years old. Tenerife, is the largest and busiest of the Canary Islands, receiving around 5 million visitors a year.Or, choose to visit Lanzarote is the Canaries’ easternmost island and is sometimes called the “Island of 100 Volcanoes.”Be humbled by Mother Nature’s destructive power on a tour of Timanfaya National Park. This region suffered a series of devastating eruptions in the 1700s and has remained largely unchanged ever since.No matter which of these magnificent islands you choose, as the sun’s molten rays merge the ocean with the earth, you’ll realise this is a place where Mother Nature and history collide.The mythical city of Atlantis may be a story, lost in the mists of time, but the Canary Islands are only a plane ride away. Whether you are searching for dramatic adventures or a sun-soaked vacation, this archipelago is alive with a powerful magic all its own.https://www.expedia.com/Canary-Island...--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Follow us on social media:Twitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia Instagram: http://instagram.com/expediaPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/Google+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Follow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: http://viewfinder.expedia.com/",travel blogs

From the lively neighbourhoods of Wellington to the breathtaking Fiordland of the South Island, there's an adventure tucked away in every corner of this impressive country. Consider living out your own Lord of the Rings adventure in Hobbiton, or hike past Mt. Doom in Tongariro National Park. Not thrilling enough? Then skydive over Auckland, go white water rafting down Kaituna River or take a leap of faith and bungee jump in Queenstown!

Alcohol and restaurant meals can range from moderate to quite expensive so prepare yourself accordingly.We'd like to thank New Zealand's incredible tourism board for allowing use of their travel footage: http://www.newzealand.com/---About New Zealand---New Zealand, exists on a remote island in the Pacific Ocean and is home to over 4.6 million people, and nearly 30 million sheep.

We made time for major attractions like Il Duomo, Sforza Castle, and Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, but we also veered away from the crowds in search of street art and interesting neighborhoods. This being Italy, we also tried to prioritize meals, sampling everything from pizza to risotto, and cappuccinos to aperitivos. The following travel guide will highlight 20 things to do when you visit Milan, Italy1) Milan Catherdral (Il Duomo - Duomo di Milano - Domm de Milan)2) Il Duomo Terrace 3) Italian Breakfast - Cappuccino and sweet Italian pastries4) Sforza Castle - Castello Sforzesco5) The Galleria - Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II 6) Risotto alla Milanese - Milan style risotto7) Street Art around Porta Ticinese 8) Colonne di San Lorenzo - Columns of San Lorenzo Roman Ruins9) Boat tour down the canal (linea traghetti gaggiano milano)10) Dine along the canal in Milan's Navigli District11) Aperitivo drinks and buffet - Apéritifs and digestifs12) Shopping in Milan down Via Torino 13) Visiting Chinatown for some Chinese food14) Ride a bicycle in Milan like a local15) Pizza al taglio (pizza al trancio) Italian pizza by the slice16) Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio containing relics of the 3 Magi17) Duomo Museum covering the cathedrals history in-depth18) New City Views with a hop-on-hop-off bus pass19) Museum of Natural History - Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Milano20) Night views of Milan nearby Il Duomohttp://nomadicsamuel.com/photo-essays...Our trip to Milan, Lombardy was part of the Blogville project where we stayed in a local apartment and experienced all of the best cultural activities, museums, restaurants, arts and entertainment the city has to offer. This city guide is our best attempt to create a mix of best attractions and off-the-beaten-path activities that you won't necessarily find in a typical Milan tourism brochure.20 Things to do in Milan Italy Travel Guide Video Transcript:Our first stop was Il Duomo, which is the most recognized attraction in the city. The cathedral took nearly six centuries to complete.So we've sat down at a little cafe and we're going to have our first Italian breakfast with cappuccino and sweet pastries.Something that surprised us about Milan is that there is a castle right in the middle of the city. Sforza Castle was built in the 15th century by the Duke of Milan, and it then underwent several restorations and expansions in the following centuries. Today it houses several of the city's most prized art possessions, including frescoes by Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo's very last sculpture.For some upscale designer shopping, Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II is the place to be.So we just found a local little restaurant and we're going to be trying a traditional dish that is very popular in this city and in the Lombardy region. We are going to have Risotto alla Milanese.The Colonne di San Lorenzo are the remains of Roman ruins that date back to the 2nd century. They are believed to have been part of a bath house.Another fun activity to try in Milan is a boat tour of the canals. The city's canals are attributed to Leonardo Da Vinci, who in 1482 was called over by the Duke of Milan to help renovate the city’s canal system.Milan's Navigli District is one of the liveliest parts of town especially when the sun goes down for dining al fresco. So we've gone out for our first Italian Aperitivo. Which is kind of like a pre-dinner drinking tradition. Basically, you get yourself a cocktail for about 10 Euros and that gives you access to this massive buffet.And that's all for our visit to Milan. We hope this video will give you some cool ideas of sights and attractions to check out.This is part of our Travel in Italy series showcasing Italian culture, Italian arts, Italian foods & Italian cuisine.

2DgICLDyHpU,Exploring Urk - Travel Vlog (Video Blog) Travel Netherlands 🇳🇱,"A guide to Urk, this is our second vlog (video blog) about Urk, a small fishing town in the ""bible belt"" of The Netherlands that still maintains its past traditions.More at http://secretsofaworldtraveller.com/2...Urk is a typical city were traditions from past still stand strong today. Especially on days like Urkerdag or Vlaggetjesdag people dress up in traditional clothing and perform chores and other things like they did back in the day. Urk is a very religious city and almost all inhabitants are or were fishermen. One of the traditions that still is going strong on a daily basis is men wearing golden earrings with ships on the waves. Some of them also have an earring with their name in the other ear. This tradition stems from back in the day when men from Urk drowned while at sea they would get a proper burial paid for by the city if they had gold in their ears. On days like Urkerdag or Vlaagetjesdag you can eat smoked salmon, smoked eel, fried kibbeling, salted raw herring and so on. But you can also buy things for your boat, old jewelry, cutlery, plates, and other knick-knacks. It is amazing to get a glance of this otherwise so closed community. While we were there we found out what Urk means and where it comes from. Urk used to be an island, until the former Zuiderzee became the lake IJsselmeer. It’s best known as a fishing village. At the harbor there is always loads of activity going on. You enjoy the action from a distance on one of the many terraces. The same harbor also offers all kinds of water sports opportunities.Highlights of UrkUrk's history goes back over one thousand years. Visit the old village and you can still feel the history it holds. Enjoy the beautiful surroundings by walking through the old village or from the water by boat. It’s highly recommended to eat some fresh fish in the harbor. You can also enjoy excellent fish dishes at one of the local restaurants. The nearby eel farm and a trip over the lake with the tourist line to Enkhuizen are also highly recommended.Visit UrkUrk is a small village with a great history, ideal for lovely walks. Charming shops, museums, beach, harbor and pool are within walking distance. Do note that the tourist line between Enkhuizen and Urk only sails in summertime. Most inhabitants of Urk consider Sunday a day of rest, so it’s best to visit Urk on weekdays or on a Saturday.Facts via Holland.comWebsite: http://secretsofaworldtraveller.comFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/secretsofawo...Twitter: https://twitter.com/SWorldTravellerGoogle Plus: https://plus.google.com/+Secretsofawo...-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-Please watch: ""A Month in China"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmTRg...-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-",travel blogs

HUuWXjW0jZs,With Mallu Traveller from Iritty to Coorg | Food from Mallu Traveller's home,"#KannurThat day, we went to  Irittty in Kannur district. Our Mallu Traveller (Shaakeer) is from Iritty. We met Shaakeer, and together we traveled from Iritty to Coorg, for a quick getaway.Subscribe Food N Travel: https://goo.gl/pZpo3ESubscribe Mallu Traveller's channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/0000jojo0Visit our blog: FoodNTravel.inOur journey started from the banks of Iritty river. Driving through the picturesque landscape of jungles and green cover, we reached Virajpetta in Coorg. Needless to say, Coorg is famed as the coffee capital of Karnataka. In Virajpetta, we saw a small kiosk on the roadside, which was run by a Malayali. When Shaakeer told me that the shop is famous for homemade wines, I decided to try. They had many varieties of wines like grapes, pineapple, gooseberry, dates, and even bird's eye chilies.We tasted the wines, and packed some to take back home. We roamed a little in the small town of Virajpetta, before heading back to Kerala. On the way back, we had delicious Kannur special snacks and a special chukku kappi from a local tea stall.  A lot more to share with you. When we reached Mallu Traveller's house, a delicious treat was waiting for us there also. Shaakeer's mother had prepared neypathal, orotti, chicken curry with chili, chicken with coconut, and what not. It was a wonderful experience.",travel blogs

ieWNzZPfZzk,Rio de Janeiro Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Rio-de-Janeiro...The early morning in Rio de Janeiro brings quiet, misty coastlines and pink-purple sunrises. The Brazilian locals are up and about soon enough, piling onto the beautiful beaches and expressing themselves through artwork, dance, and the ubiquitous Rio de Janeiro partying. A Rio de Janeiro tour must stop at Christ the Redeemer, the ubiquitous statue that watches over the city from above the Tijuca National Forest. Take the cable car to the lookout point on Sugarloaf Mountain, the city’s iconic peak, and try not to look down – it’s a long way to drop!After a morning spent in nature, your Rio de Janeiro sightseeing should continue in the city proper. Join the sun worshippers at Copacabana, where you can stake out a patch of beach or float out to sea with the paddleboarders. Shop for souvenirs in Ipanema, or take part in the street dances, festivals, and parades that may spontaneously break out. The “Cidade Maravilhosa,” or the marvelous city, has much to offer all of its visitors.

The London Underground is a masterpiece made up of 12 lines that stop at 270 stations in 6 zones. Most tourists will probably stick to Zones 1 and 2, so pay for your tickets accordingly. 3 Ways to Pay for Tube Fare:1. Travel Card - This is a disposal paper ticket that can be valid for a day, a week or even more. 2. Oyster Card - This is a plastic prepaid card that you can put money on and pay as you go. It costs £5, so don't forget to return it when your trip is over. You'll get back the £5 and any remaining balance. 3. Contactless Credit Card - If you have one of these cards, you can use it at the security barriers to tap your way in.

DRMZBDqBiP8,10 Reasons to Visit Ukraine Travel Tips,"Are you considering traveling to Ukraine? Come find out 10 reasons to visit Ukraine along with some of our best travel tips to make your trip to Ukraine as enjoyable as possible.On a personal level, Ukraine was the most pleasantly surprising country we visited this year on tour across Europe. Not knowing what to expect and not having much time to prepare we arrived in Ukraine with fresh eyes while hitting the ground running.Overall we visited Kiev and Lviv and left wanting to explore more of Ukraine. How expensive is Ukraine? Our top 10 reasons to visit Ukraine covers accommodation, food, attractions and transportation along with a slew of other travel tips.10 Reasons to Visit Ukraine Travel Tips1) Ukraine is Affordable for travelers -$15-35 per night for entire apartments using Airbnb-Great value meals for about $5-10 per person for a full meal or less for a budget meal-Metro tickets in Kiev only cost 5 HRV ($0.20)-Groceries reasonably priced - we loved chocolate + wine2) Ukraine is an Underrated Country to Visit-We didn't encounter many other tourists - especially International visitors-Attractions were not overrun and sometimes if we visited early enough on a weekday we had places to ourselves-The only exception to that is churches because they're active places of worship3) Safety-News coverage would suggest Ukraine is unsafe but we found Kiev and Lviv to be very safe when we visited (along the border with Russia could be a different story)-We walked around with our cameras without any issues-No hassles while walking around-I went jogging at night in Kyiv -Locals are out enjoying life - playing chess in parks, eating in restaurants and using public spaces for concerts4) Friendliness of locals in Ukraine-Really good and friendly service at restaurants (some English spoken most of the time)-Great AirBNB hosts who both went above and beyond to help us-Even with language barrier smiles aplenty-As a travel tip for Ukraine learn to read the Cyrillic alphabet 5) Traditional Ukrainian Food in Kiev and Lviv-Good local food scene - for all price points-Typically Ukrainian cuisine is hearty and filling-Some of our favorite Ukrainian food includes the following:a) varenyky (dumplings)  b) banosh (polenta, bacon and sheep's cheese)c) deruny (potato pancakes with sauce)d) borscht6) Thriving International Food Scene-Georgian cuisine -Korean food-SushiItalian style pizzas-Pop up cafes and food trucks in parks and on street corners7) Transportation -awesome metro system in Kiev (grand stations and deep underground + affordable prices)-deepest station in the world in Kyiv (5 minutes)-great connections from airport to city center in Kyiv-taking the train from Kiev to Lviv and it was efficient, on time and comfortable8) Architecture in Ukraine-interesting mix of a bit of Soviet but mostly ornate European architecture-some parts look like they could belong in Paris or Buenos Aires and other parts are distinctly soviet-painted in cheerful colors 9) Ukrainian Churches in Kyiv and Lviv-Orthodox churches and monasteries in Kyiv - main attractions-ornate and onion domes - impressive on inside and outside -women need to cover up in Orthodox churches -active places or prayer-witnessed weddings in Lviv Lviv features numerous types of churches10) Variety and diversity of places to visit in Ukraine-Kyiv is very different from Lviv (worth visiting both) -We didn't get to Odessa which has been highly recommended-Other places of potential interest include Chernivtsi, Ivano-Frankivsk and Carpathian MountainsWhat are some other places in Ukraine you'd recommend visiting?

A few days later we found the footage of their.. inspired approach.Leaving Ibiza, we headed for the Spanish mainland, and met up with friends as we coastal hopped our way south. Our trips ashore were made more challenging without a proper dinghy so we had to draft the kids dinghy and paddle-board into action.We had an awesome final sail into Almerimar where we celebrated with fish n chips, hung up our flip flops and prepared to try Spanish school for the kids and prepare a long boat maintenance list!

As one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, you'll find yourself exploring caves, the historical center 'sassi' and UNESCO heritage churches along with eating delicious Italian food. An exciting announcement is that Matera was declared Italian host of European Capital of Culture for 2019. 1) Chiesa rupestre di San Pietro Barisano2) Convent of Saint Agostino3) Cathedral of Matera4) Chiesa di Santa Maria di Idris5) Murgia National Park6) La Grotta nei Sassi Restaurant7) Storica Casa Grotta di vico Solitario8) Palombaro Lungo - Underground Matera Tour 9) Ristorante Nadi10) Matera at NightGEAR WE USEPanasonic GH5: http://amzn.to/2yqTUyiCanon G7X ii: http://amzn.to/2yqtM6BRode Video Micro: http://amzn.to/2wTguTM Joby Gorilla Pod: http://amzn.to/1PgoY5F SanDisk 16GB Extreme Pro: http://amzn.to/25KEErsSOCIAL MEDIA & TRAVEL BLOGSAUDREY:blog: http://thatbackpacker.com/instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thatbackpac...facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thatbackpackertwitter: https://twitter.com/ThatBackpacker SAMUEL:blog: http://nomadicsamuel.com/ facebook: https://www.facebook.com/nomadicsamuel twitter: https://twitter.com/NomadicSamuelinstagram: https://www.instagram.com/nomadicsamuel/Our visit Matera travel guide documentary covers some of the top attractions including a food guide to Italian cuisine, top sightseeing tourist attractions and the city by day and night including visiting churches, parks, the old town 'sassi', quirky neighborhoods, museums and caves. We also cover off-the-beaten-path outdoor activities you won't find in a typical Matera tourism brochure, Matera itinerary or Matera city tour also known as Matera, Italia.10 Things to do in Matera, Italy Travel Guide Food Video Transcript:One destination that’s been at the very top of our travel bucket list for a while now is Matera, and on this trip to Italy, we were determined to make it happen!Nicknamed “the stone city”, Matera has been quite literally dug out of the rock, and it’s a sight you won’t soon forget. Set on the slope of a rocky ravine, the landscape is dominated by cave dwellings, zigzagging staircases, and early churches that hold some incredible frescoes once you set foot inside.During our visit, we stayed in the “sassi”, which is the ancient town, and in our opinion, the best way to soak in the vibe of this place. Now in this video, we’re going to take you on a tour of the city and show you some of the things you can see, do and eat when you visit Matera. Matera is well-known for its rupestrian churches, carved into the rock and covered in frescoes.We first stopped by Chiesa Rupestre di San Pietro Barisano, which is the largest rock church in the city of Matera.We wanted to show you the frescoes, so we continued to Convento di Sant’Agostino, a church and convent dating back to the late 16th Century. We started walking uphill via a series of staircases and winding streets, until we found ourselves in front of Matera Cathedral.The rocky landscape we noticed is called Murgia (MoorJa) National Park and it’s an archaeological site with cliffs, gorges & caves.Let’s take a quick break to introduce you to Materan cuisine. Like most of the establishments in Matera, this restaurant was set in a cave and we ate pasta, wine & dessert?We spent a lot of time visiting cave churches, but for a look at how locals lived in these troglodyte dwellings, we visited Casa Grotta. The Sassi District is a made up of a network of dwellings carved into the steep slopes of the valley walking into the Casa Grotta.We visited Palombaro Lungo, a massive water cistern that sits directly under Matera’s main square.After visiting Palombaro Lungo, we also found ourselves in front of the ruins of Chiesa del Santo Spirito. The church sits beneath Piazza Vittorio Veneto where you can make out frescoes on the walls.Continuing our quest for Materan cuisine, we ended up at Ristorante Nadi - another cave restaurant that we stumbled upon by chance to see if we could get through a 4 course meal.Our final recommendation for Matera would be to explore the city at night. Matera looks magical between sunset and blue hour and it was a pleasure to wander around with camera in hand.And that’s a wrap for Matera! We hope you guys enjoyed discovering Italy’s famed Stone City, and we’ll see you soon with more videos from Italy.This is part of our Travel in Italy video series showcasing Italian food, Italian culture and Italian cuisine.

cAy_tsQfsr0,"The Ultimate KENYAN STREET FOOD TOUR in Mombasa - Coastal East African Food, Kenya!","►Check out Farhana’s channel now: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCruH...►Subscribe for 2 new videos per week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe►T-shirts and caps available now: https://migrationology.com/store/Mombasa is a beautiful city located in Kenya, on the east coast of Africa. It’s a melting pot of a city, full of culture and delicious food. In this video, I met up with Farhana and Samil, both from Mombasa, and both love to eat.Lighthouse - First place we headed on this Kenyan street food tour of Mombasa is along the coast called Mama Ngina drive, or Lighthouse. You’ll find an abundance of small snacks along the road with a view over the cliffs of the Indian ocean. Probably my favorite street food was the fried cassava chips, which are fried fresh, put into bags, then seasoned with salt, chili powder, and lime juice.Here are the main street food snacks we had:Coconut, heart of palm, cassava - 340 KES ($3.33) totalCassava chipsRoasted and fried cassavaCoconutsSweet potato, corn, many thingsNext we headed into the heart of Mombasa to eat from a roadside shop selling a mixture of bhajias, fried potatoes, and fried chilies. This is legendary street food in Mombasa! When you order she puts all the fried things onto a plate and douses them in coconut chutney and hot sauce. The combination is delicious, and  my favorite item was the fried chilies.Bhajia plate combo - 90 KES ($0.88)Azad Ice Cream - We then had sugarcane juice, a Mombasa Kenyan favorite. They added sugarcane, plus ginger and lime.Damascus Shawarma - 200 KES ($1.96) - One of the popular food trucks in Mombasa is Damascus shawarma. It was pretty good.Abbasi Darbar - To finish off this Kenyan food tour of Mombasa, we ended with a  mega meat feast at Abbasi Darbar, a great place to fulfill all your meat needs. We ordered most of what they offer on the menu. Everything was delicious,  but I think the winner for me was the spring chicken tikka.Total price - 1,900 KES ($18.64)Again, thank you for Farhana for taking me on this amazing Kenyan street food tour of Mombasa, Kenya.

Why?Quite literally, the atmosphere. Vancouver’s clean air is thanks to it’s really close connection to nature. There are mountains and forests surrounding the City, and the Pacific ocean is right on the cities doorstep. Here the great outdoors isn’t just a place, it’s a way of life. But it’s a modern City waiting to be discovered as well. So in this guide, we’re going to help you make the most of it! We’re going to look at food, money, transport, and a whole lot more, but first let’s get from the airport. Vancouver International airport is less than 10 miles from Downtown area, and is Canada's second busiest airport, after Toronto Pearson International.Getting between the airport and the City Centre is relatively straightforward – a 20-minute taxi ride will cost around $45. Another way into the City is the SkyTrain – it's a bit like London's DLR with driverless carriages, you take the Canada line for half an hour or so, and it costs around $7.Vancouver has an extensive public transport network, as well as being a really easy place to dive. Here’s what you need to know:Now it’s not often that we can tell someone to drive a car through a major City, but in Vancouver drive away until your heart's content! We hired a car and cannot recommend it enough. Thanks to the Cities grid system, wide roads with plenty of easy understood signs and generally well-tempered drivers - driving was an absolute doddle! There’s ample parking wherever you go, even at the busy tourist hotspots, not to mention fuel is cheap, and traffic generally wasn’t too bad in our experience.",travel blogs

vzSHcyXfNPw,Iceland Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"With a population of only 300,000, Iceland can feel like the most isolated place on earth, yet its capital Reykjavik, is only a three-hour flight from London and just under six from New York. Reykjavik is relaxed and welcoming, yet possesses a cultural life that holds its own against other European capitals. Most buildings are built simple and low to beat the North Atlantic winds. However, the city is also graced with grand civic architecture inspired by Iceland’s natural beauty, such as the soaring central tower of Hallgrímskirkja. Many of the country’s most popular sights are within easy reach of Reykjavík. Immerse yourself in the spirit of Iceland, at the Blue Lagoon. Then spend a day or two in The Golden Circle, an area which encompasses three of Iceland’s greatest natural wonders; Thingvellir National Park, the Geysir Geothermal Field, and Gullfoss. Iceland’s main ring road strings together an endless series of epic landscapes. Less than two hours drive east of Reykjavik are two of the world’s most beautiful waterfalls, Seljalandsfoss and Skógafoss. Continue eastward towards Vík, Iceland’s southern-most village, where you’ll find the dramatic landscapes of Black Beach, Reynisdrangar, and Dyrholaey. Follow the ring road for another two hours into the ethereal light of Jökulsárlón Lake, where icebergs break away from Europe’s largest glacier and float for years before tumbling out to sea. Head north and feel the earth rumble at Europe’s mightiest waterfall, Dettifoss. Then explore the Myvatn region, a tranquil lake surrounded by nature in all its violent beauty. Take a careful walk through the boiling landscape of Namafjall, lose yourself amid the lava pillars of Dimmuborgir, and peer into the caldera of Krafla Volcano. Known as the Capital of the North, Akureyri is the perfect place to warm up and enjoy some creature comforts, before heading off into the wilds again. In Iceland, every side road is a story waiting to unfold. So come, and live your own Icelandic story, it’s one you’ll keep telling for the rest of your days.https://www.expedia.com/Iceland.d79.D...--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Follow us on social media:Twitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia Instagram: http://instagram.com/expediaPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/Google+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Follow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: http://viewfinder.expedia.com/",travel blogs
R7vmHGAshi8,How to travel the world with almost no money | Tomislav Perko | TEDxTUHH,"Many people daydream about traveling the world, but all of them have the same excuse - lack of money. Tomislav, after traveling the world for years with almost no money, shows how it is possible for everyone to do the same, if they really want to.Tomislav Perko, 29, is a travel writer from Croatia. After a career of a stockbroker, broke because of the financial crisis, he hits the road and turns it into his home. He uses alternative ways of traveling – hitchhiking, couchsurfing, working/volunteering, and manages to wander around the world with just a little bit of money in his pocket, meeting the most amazing people on the way.Five years later, he publishes a book “1000 Days of Spring” and goes around giving lectures about what it means to live on the road.

This Tokyo guide also shows what not do in Japan as well as things not do in Japan based on Japanese culture.  These Japanese Travel Tips cover Tattoos in a Japanese Onsen, Non-tipping culture, riding the train in Japan, Wifi in Japan, Japanese Hotels, Japanese Police, etc.  Basically, these are the things to know before going to Japan.

You can go to most major electronics store and they should carry it.  There are a few options, but I’ll cover the 2 basic types that I think is the best  for travelers.  (1)  SIM card with a daily data transfer limits 220mb per day. You can get it for 7 days or 15 days.  (2) SIM cards with a total data transfer limit of 1.5 Gb or 3GB that work for 30 day period.

TdNiIYyBJYk,Blogger Base at ITB Berlin 2018 - for Travel Bloggers and Influencers,"Blogger Base took place at ITB Berlin for the first time this year, March 2018. Blogger Base was designed as a dedicated workspace for travel bloggers and travel influencers to hang-out, network and re-charged their devices. Blogger Base is part of a wider travel blogger program at ITB Berlin, which includes the Travel Blogger Speed Dating or Speed Networking session as well as the blogger presentations on the eTravel World stage.https://www.itb-berlin.de/en/Visitors...Read our blog listing all the travel social media and digital marketing conference around the world.https://www.travelmedia.ie/blog/trave...Video transcript:- - ITB Berlin's one of the most professional events on my calendar so I'll have to be here. It's just a really awesome event. - Actually I live here in Berlin and I come because it's important to make contacts and network with other bloggers. - First of all, I'm German so I want to come to Berlin to meet with the German brands and second of all it's the largest tourism fair in the world and that's why I definitely want to come. - So ITB decided to set up the ITB Blogger Base due to the high demand that we saw during the last few years. First of all, the amount of bloggers raised a lot so we even see the number of bloggers grow more than journalists so we said, ""Okay, we need to give them a place to blog."" You know, community is really, really important for them so this is the place. This is the Blogger Base and we're really happy it worked out so well. - I have been to the Blog Base. It's an upgrade from last year. We've got proper chairs, we've got WiFi, we've got charging stations and even a nice cup of tea. - I like the idea of Blogger Base a lot because it's always great to network with other bloggers. Connect with them, see what they're doing. Learn from each other and great networking. - Blogger Base is a great idea. It makes you to communicate with other bloggers, to have a better interaction with them and to get to know each other also. - Blogger Base, it's a good chance to meet your colleagues catch up about the day, recharge your devices and also just have a space to work because as everyone knows, it's super busy on the floor and it's bustling and crazy and lots of people and there's never really a chance anywhere to sit down and catch up on your work because ultimately, while we're here, we still have our work that we have to complete and emails to catch up on so it's a good space to relax. - Travel blogger, ITB's the biggest travel conference right now, in the world and it's a good chance to meet companies to meet other bloggers that do the same what you love to do. - So the ITB Blogger Speed Dating is 90 minutes of high speed dating quality. So what happens is, we have approximately 180 bloggers this year who get together with 180 exhibitors from ITB Berlin and they get eight minutes each to pitch their blog, to pitch their company, and then see if it's a match. We do have a pre-set matching schedule. The system, you can filter what you would like, what you're interested in and then you can pre-match already. So, you come to the Blogger Speed Dating and you have nine meetings, eight minutes time and hopefully a lot of corporations. - It's really great value, the contacts. Because, some of them contact you so they usually follow up with it. Especially the German destinations. And I always get good corporations out of it. - Speed networking is kind of important for me. I mean, it's the first introduction to meet new people. It's like a good, quick introduction and then you can build up on it. So from that perspective, it's important. Yes. - It's fantastic. It's such a great opportunity to meet people face to face. It's the one reason you come to ITB. is to get that face to face meeting. Even if it's for a few minutes. Invaluable for me as a blogger. It's one of the reasons I love coming back here. - I do do the speed networking at ITB. Again, this is an opportunity where you have a chance to meet maybe up to 10 people within a small space of time. It can be a little bit more easier than running around all the halls and trying to pre-plan meetings. It's very targeted. They come to you or you go to them and there is a chance to do a miniature pitch within that set-up. For me, that will be my biggest afternoon here. I'm seeing lots of people that I genuinely really want to have a chat with. - Besides the ITB Blogger Base that we created newly this year and the Bloggers Speed Networking which was really successful, part of the ITB Convention is the e-Travel World so what happens in the e-Travel World, it's all about travel technology and of course, bloggers are a huge topic at the e-Travel World. There's some bloggers giving advice to the companies on how to work with bloggers. It's a lot about influencer marketing. How can companies work with bloggers to create good content and things like that.",travel blogs

Beaming, shining, gushing about how really nothing at all brings me enormous joy. And here, we've been invited by friends to a festival. Authentic, genuine, super cool. We were the only, only, only non-locals there, and I love those moments. When we are just honored enough, lucky enough to be around kind-hearted people who extend an invitation of love to us. By the way, my hair looks unbelievably stunning.( I know it's not related to anything I am trying to share with you, but a- my vanity is alas, mine and b- my mind does that four hundred times a second). I loved that short little period of time between attempt number one and attempt number two for purple hair. When I got the most-amazing-I-have-ever-gotten-in-my-life-haircut. . I looked soooo good. Now, sitting here in Cambodia with my fried-bleach-blonde-highlights-after-the-purple-attempt-number-two-faded hair and thinking how much I'd love that amazing hairdresser in Lima, Peru to fix my hair up again. These days it is in a bun or a ponytail all day. Advantages to that are that now my family can tell me all day, ""Girl, yo ponytail from the back looks riDicUlous! ""So, where were we.... annoying-as-hell fly won't leave me alone. I am practicing ahima (nonharm to all beings) so trying not to swat it to DEATH! but it won't let me be.

-KMZW_zwRfc,San Diego Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/San-Diego.d178...Welcome to San Diego, often called the birthplace of California.Start your San Diego tour with a stop in Old Town, a historic park filled with buildings dating back to the 1820s. If you want something a little livelier, go a few miles south to check out the Gaslamp District, full of Victorian-era architecture and a thriving bar and club scene. Bringing the kids with you, or looking for a more sedate afternoon? Stop by the San Diego Zoo and spend some time with the many animals taking up residence there – including some of the few pandas outside of China.Explore San Diego’s ties to the sea by touring the U.S.S. Midway, Navy Pier, and Maritime Museum. From there, it’s just a skip across the bay to Coronado, where you can lay out in the sun and soak up some rays in a quiet beach town. Round out your day with a trip to “the jewel,” better known as La Jolla, and indulge in some of the best seafood and Mexican food you’ll find anywhere. Don’t forget to say “Hi” to the sea lions.

This week we are exploring the city of love, city of lights and city of art. This video will be showing you the top 50 things to do while you visit Paris.So we're wrapping things up here. What would be your one tip for visiting Paris? Well, I have recently spent a whole ten days here in summer. I would say that if you really want to visit the art galleries, the museums and all of the main attractions you should probably avoid summer and like either come in the spring or the fall or even winter. Because the lines are insane and sometimes you have to wait like an hour and a half or two hours.So how about you? What are your final thoughts on Paris? So my finals thoughts is obviously Paris is one of the top cities in the world in terms of attractions. There is going to be garbage, there is going to be lines, there is going to be some areas that are a bit of an eyesore. But there is also a lot of beauty and there is also a lot to do here. And that concludes our guide of the top 50 things to do and see in Paris. We hope you enjoyed watching, and let us know if there are other places you would add to this list. This is part of our Travel in France series showcasing French culture, French arts, French foods & French cuisine.Music in this video courtesy of Audio Network",travel blogs

We also cover off-the-beaten-path outdoor activities you won't find in a typical Lisbon tourism brochure, Lisbon itinerary or Lisbon city tour also known as Lisboa, Portuguesa.20 Things to do in Lisbon, Portugal Travel Video Transcript:We feel like we know this city well, so in this Lisbon travel guide we’re going to show you around what we think are some of the best attractions. We only had 3 days in the city this time around, so this Lisbon itinerary will be perfect for any of you visiting on a long weekend escape.We kicked off our first morning with a ride on Lisbon’s most iconic tram line:#28 bound for panoramic vistas and a hilltop castle. After postcard perfect views looking down over Alfama we went towards the castle, with a little detour offering a bit of street art.St George Castle is a Moorish castle that looks down over the historic centre and the Tagus River. It’s one of the main tourist landmarks in the city and you get great views of Lisbon.We circled back to visit the Jeronimos Monastery. Construction of this monastery was ordered by King Manuel, who selected the religious order of Hieronymite monks to occupy the monastery.Pastéis de nata were created by the monks at the Jerónimos Monastery, and seeing as we were right next door, this was a very logical stop. After browsing at the Sunday Market we walked over to the Santa Justa Elevator, which is the only street lift in Lisbon for public service.We hope you enjoyed our Lisbon travel guide and found it useful for planning your own trip. If you have any other suggestions of things to do in Lisbon please share those in the comments below.This is part of our Travel in Portugal video series showcasing Portuguese food, Portuguese culture and Portuguese cuisine.

of4Pn78y52A,How I Turned my Passion for Travel into a Paycheck – Oneika Raymond at Craft + Commerce 2018,"Until less than three years ago, Oneika Raymond was a full-time teacher.In her talk at Craft + Commerce 2018, she shared her story about making a full-time living as an international teacher, and keeping a travel blog to chronicle her adventures. There were some killer aspects of her teaching job: Short work days, great pay, plenty of vacation time, and lots of free time to work on her travel blog, But she began to realize that she was much more passionate about the travel part of her lifestyle than the actual teaching part. In this talk, Oneika inspires us to not spend another minute doing what we don’t love, and to instead pursue what we do.// This is Oneika's main stage talk from Craft + Commerce 2018.

URi_SsPtbhs,"How to Become a Travel Blogger: The Good, the Bad & the Ugly","How to Become a Travel Blogger - http://sassyzengirl.com/TravelBlogBecoming a professional travel blogger takes skills and a solid business attitude.  And - it takes time to get to the point of actually making some money, or a decent living of it.A number of skills must be mastered for Travel blogging:1) you need to become and excellent writer - and I mean: blogging style, which is very different from regular writing. Blogging is more like a conversation with a good friend over a cup of coffee than an article in the New York Times.Short paragraphs, easy on the eye, kolloquial phrases and an engaging style are keys to reach an audience in the internet world.There are numerous resources for good blog writing training that teach you how to become a travel blogger and the best one is a guest blogging course mentioned in this link, http://sassyzengirl.com/GuestBloggingGuest Blogging is also a great way to build a following which brings us to our second point of important skills to master as a professional travel blogger:2) Building a large following, both blog subscribers and very importantly on Social Media.Without a substantial following sponsors and travel boards will not be interested in collaboration with a Travel blogger, because there is no potential for them to market their products, hotels etc.http://sassyzengirl.com/TravelBloggin...This also includes mastering the art of ranking high in Google: SEOHo to become a Travel Blogger also includes an understanding of how to structure and article, how to perform keyword research, how to set up your travel blog etc - and you need to start from day 1 because Google ranking usually takes months to show any results, especially for a brand new travel site that still needs to build authority and credibility with google. SEO Video course:SEO 1 - https://youtu.be/U08NeWHApBUSEO 2 - kw - https://youtu.be/MmdlJi69S7ISEO 3 - OnPage - https://youtu.be/3hTvkkMXuycSEO 4 - OffPage - https://youtu.be/zpTumr0uy2Q 3) You must become a budget travel ninja - know how to travel for free, get paid to travel, get cheap air tickets etchttp://sassyzengirl.com/Budget-Travel...Most importantly, you need to understand that becoming a professional travel blogger means becoming an entrepreneur. You are building a business and a brand and that takes time, mastering new skills and iron determination.Most travel bloggers fail at monetizing their blog in any significant way, because they never bother to learn and master the skills necessary and they are not really serious or understand that a professional travel blog is a business - and not a hobby.As an example of a great - and immensely successful - travel blog check out http://theplanetd.com - one of the absolute top blogs in the world with hundreds of thousands of followers. It also includes a number of excellent post on how to become a travel blogger.But don't worry - they, too, didn't start big, they build their brand over many years and became experts and entrepreneurs and eventually reached these heights - and you can, too.More Digital Nomad Training Videos:Digital Nomad Jobs - https://youtu.be/3MS6Z9KKOMkKindle Publishing - https://youtu.be/k1UddId7Rw8Entrepreneur Bluprints - https://youtu.be/t0727M7iY4cBuild a blog in 10 min - https://youtu.be/iakdyz5RJDINew Bloggers: Start here - https://youtu.be/b9W-8_jy3fIhttp://facebook.com/SassyZenGirlhttp://twitter.com/SassyZenGirlhttp://pinterest.com/SassyZenGirlhttp://instagram.com/SassyZenGirltravelshttp://google.com/+SassyZenGirltravelshttps://plus.google.com/+SassyZenGirl - NEWhttp://www.linkedin.com/in/Luxury-SEOTravel Videos:Australia - Indian Pacific Train: https://youtu.be/QYoC5k9FYz8#howtobecomeatravelblogger#becometravelblogger#travelblogging#travelblogger#travelbloggingcourse#professionaltravelblogger",travel blogs

M6nMXsBErnE,Flight TUS35 Travel Ukulele Review! Mini travel blog and Bieber for Sheriff?,"Don't be fooled by the size of this instrument.  The Flight TUS35 is tiny yet MIGHTY!  With smart design choices such as a strong neck, back and sides made of ABS, the 0 nut, compensated saddle, solid geared tuners, and a rounded back makes this travel ukulele a serious instrument with a great tone.  Come join me as I test out the Flight TUS35 on a hot day on the boat to see if it withstood the hot temperatures and the great outdoors.  Thank you to my Instagram followers that gave me some amazing questions to answer about the Flight TUS35.  I play several ukuleles side by side so that you can compare the tone to other ukuleles made of different tone woods.  CORRECTION!  The graphic for the Grace VanderWaal Signature ukulele was cut off.  It has a glossy finish to look like walnut, but it is laminate sapele.
